The near-surface seismic structure (to a depth of about 1000 m), particularly the shear-wave velocity (Vs), can strongly affect the propagation of seismic waves, and therefore must be accurately calibrated for ground motion simulations and seismic hazard assessment. The Vs of the top ~30 m of the crust (Vs30) is often well-characterized from borehole studies, geotechnical measurements, and water wells, while the velocities of the material deeper than about 1000 m are typically determined by tomography studies. However, the material parameters between these two regions are typically poorly constrained due to lack of data constraints. A widely-used method for incorporating the near-surface earth structure is incorporated in the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) Community Velocity Models (CVMs) by interpolating Vs from Vs30 measurements to the S-wave velocity at 350 m \citep{elyVs30derivedNearsurfaceSeismic2010}. However, our 3D simulations of the 2014 M5.1 La Habra earthquake in the Los Angeles area using the SCEC CVM-S4.26.M01 model significantly underpredict low-frequency (< 1 Hz) ground motions at rock sites for the \citet{elyVs30derivedNearsurfaceSeismic2010} method. On the other hand, extending the Vs30-based refinement of the shallow velocities down to a depth of about 1000 meters improves the fit between our synthetics and seismic data at rock sites considerably, without compromising the fit at soil sites. We recommend that our proposed near-surface velocity refinement at rock sites down to about 1000 meters be incorporated in CVM-S4.26M01, as well as considered for other CVMs.

\section{Introduction} \label{vs30:intro}
Ground motion amplification due to the near-surface structure is widely accepted and well-studied \citep{gilbertSanFranciscoEarthquake1907,fieldModifiedGroundMotionAttenuation2000}, and needs to be incorporated in numerical  simulations of earthquakes to produce accurate ground motion results. The time-averaged shear-wave velocity (Vs) in the upper 30 m (Vs30) is routinely used as a representation of the site condition in ground motion prediction models and building codes \citep{borcherdtEstimatesSiteDependentResponse1994,bozorgniaNGAWest2ResearchProject2014,internationalcodecouncil2015IBCInternational2014}. For this purpose, several methods have proposed useful methods to derive Vs30 from topography (Wald et al. 2007), supplemented with near-surface geological information (Thompson et al. 2014; Wills et al. 2015). However, with the continuing advancement in the Vs30-based methodologies by the seismic hazard community (e.g., Thompson et al. 2014, Heath et al. 2020), it is clear  that Vs30 is not a good single proxy for the estimation of site amplification (e.g., Steidl 2000, Lee and Trifunac 2010 and Shingaki et al. 2018). One reason is the prohibitive cost of measuring velocity profiles at the resolution needed for seismic hazard analysis, leading to highly approximate results from interpolating limited Vs30 values and combining geological units. Furthermore, Vs30 value is found to be a product complicated by age and grain size, and therefore includes inherent inaccuracy within the soil category classification. Finally, Vs30 cannot account for depth-dependent or lateral velocity variations,  which all affect the seismic wavefields.

While the current approximations to correct for site effects serve an important purpose, a fully physics-based approach for seismic hazard analysis presents itself as a more difficult, but robust, long-term goal. In such an approach, the full wavefield is computed deterministically to maximum frequencies of 5 Hz or higher using a realistic 3D velocity model (e.g., Withers et al. 2019a,b; Hu and Olsen 2021). A necessary ingredient in producing accurate synthetic seismograms using physics-based simulations is an accurate velocity model for the model region. Community Velocity Models (CVMs) have been developed for such purpose, e.g., the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) CVMs (Small et al., 2017), the Cascadia CVM (Stephenson et al., 2017) and the Subsurface Structure Model maintained by the Japan Seismic Hazard Information Station (Fujiwara et al. 2017). These velocity models are often generated by combining 3D tomographic inversion from seismic waves (e.g., Tape et al. 2009,  Lee et al. 2014) with shallow geotechnical information (e.g., Vs30) and often yield a fixed resolution of a few hundreds of meters along depth. The spatial resolution of large-scale tomographic studies is generally limited by the density of ray paths, particularly in the upper ~1000 m of the crust. While a relatively coarse resolution may be acceptable for the lower crust, that is insufficient to resolve shallower, more complicated structures with more rapid velocity variation. Unfortunately, data constraints on the velocities for the material between depths of about 30 m and 1000 m are limited to relatively rare seismic refraction studies (e.g. Teague et al. 2018) or borehole logs (e.g, Stellar 1996, Thompson  2012).

Previous studies have attempted to bridge the data constraints at shallow (<~30 m) and deeper (>~1000 m) depths for rock sites. For example, Boore and Joyner (1997) generated a continuous depth-dependent Vs function based on 3 different intervals. The Vs profile in the upper 30 m was constructed from interpolated shallow average arrival times. At depths below 4 km, Vs was estimated from the P-wave velocity (Vp), measured from earthquake location studies and velocity surveys, on the assumption of a fixed Poisson ratio at 0.25. Finally, the shallow and deeper Vs were connected using two power-law functions.  Ely et al. (2010) proposed a generalized method that modifies the surface Vs from Vs30 and then interpolates velocities down to 350 m depth, which has been implemented in some of the SCEC CVMs. The Vs30 values adopted by Ely et al. (2010) were obtained from the geology-based Vs30 map of Wills and Clahan (2006) for California and the topography-based estimations by Wald and Allen (2007) outside California. The determination of  350 m used for the depth extent of the Vs refinements by Ely et al. (2010) was based on qualitative comparison between seismic synthetics and data records from the 2008 M5.4 Chino Hills, CA, earthquake.

In this study, we aim to quantify the accuracy of the top 1000 m of crust in the greater Los Angeles area in California using using 3D wavefield simulations of the 2014 M5.1 La Habra earthquake, as well as propose an improved refinement method for rock site, if needed. The paper is organized as follows: we first briefly introduce our numerical approach to obtain the simulated ground motions, present an approximate 1D analysis of site amplification to evaluate the potential to improve site amplification at rock sites, and finally evaluate different rock site refinements using 3D wave propagation simulation and provide our recommendation.
