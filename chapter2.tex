The near-surface seismic structure (to a depth of about 1000 m), particularly the shear-wave velocity (Vs), can strongly affect the propagation of seismic waves, and therefore must be accurately calibrated for ground motion simulations and seismic hazard assessment. The Vs of the top ~30 m of the crust (Vs30) is often well-characterized from borehole studies, geotechnical measurements, and water wells, while the velocities of the material deeper than about 1000 m are typically determined by tomography studies. However, the material parameters between these two regions are typically poorly constrained due to lack of data constraints. A widely-used method for incorporating the near-surface earth structure is incorporated in the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) Community Velocity Models (CVMs) by interpolating Vs from Vs30 measurements to the S-wave velocity at 350 m \citep{elyVs30derivedNearsurfaceSeismic2010}. However, our 3D simulations of the 2014 M5.1 La Habra earthquake in the Los Angeles area using the SCEC CVM-S4.26.M01 model significantly underpredict low-frequency (< 1 Hz) ground motions at rock sites for the \citet{elyVs30derivedNearsurfaceSeismic2010} method. On the other hand, extending the Vs30-based refinement of the shallow velocities down to a depth of about 1000 meters improves the fit between our synthetics and seismic data at rock sites considerably, without compromising the fit at soil sites. We recommend that our proposed near-surface velocity refinement at rock sites down to about 1000 meters be incorporated in CVM-S4.26M01, as well as considered for other CVMs.
