  abstract = {Near-surface attenuation and site effects are investigated using the seismograms of 17 local earthquakes recorded at depths of 0, 0.3, 1.5, 2.5, and 2.9 km in the Cajon Pass borehole, southern California. The borehole penetrates 500 m of Miocene sandstone and then crystalline, granitic basement rock. Previous estimates of site response have been limited to shallower holes, where the surface reflection interferes with the upgoing direct wave, and the deepest sensor is not below the severe near-surface effects, in bedrock. Spectral ratios of the direct P and S waves for each earthquake between the different recording levels are well modeled with frequency-independent Q and amplification. At the borehole, QP ∼ 27 ± 8, and QS ∼ 21 ± 7 in the upper 2.9 km, increasing from QP ∼26 and QS ∼15 in the upper 300 m to QP ∼133 and QS ∼47 between 1.5 and 3 km. One event was also recorded at a surface granite site, less than 1.5 km from the wellhead. Comparison of the 2.9-km recording with that at this granite site gives QP ∼50 and QS ∼23. The similarity of these values with those of previous studies at a wide range of sites suggests that Q is very low in the near surface, independent of rock type. Near-surface amplification appears considerably more site dependent. At the wellhead, the amplifications at 1 Hz of the direct P and S waves are 12 ± 7 and 13 ± 7, respectively. These values include the free-surface effect and are in reasonable agreement with the impedance contrast from the borehole logs. At the granite site, amplification of both P and S waves is less than four; direct-wave amplification at the wellhead is therefore at least three times that of the granite site. The spectra of the direct and coda waves of the one earthquake recorded at both the wellhead and granite sites are compared with the corresponding 2.9-km recording. Coda-wave amplification is in good agreement with the direct wave at the rock site, but at the borehole, the coda-wave amplification factor overestimates the direct-wave amplification by a factor of 3.},

The hanging-wall effect is included with an improved model that varies smoothly as a function of the source properties (M, dip, depth), and the site location. The standard deviation is magnitude dependent with smaller magnitudes leading to larger standard deviations. The short-period standard deviation model for soil sites is also distant-dependent due to nonlinear site response, with smaller standard deviations at short distances.},

  abstract = {Models for ergodic site response are frequently conditioned on timeaveraged shear-wave velocity in the upper 30 m of a site (VS30). However, in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) of North America, only 13\% of the seismic recording stations contributing data to the Next Generation Attenuation-Subduction (NGA-Sub) project have measurement-based VS30 values. We present a shear-wave velocity (VS) measurement database compiled from public sources from Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and British Columbia to support the development of proxy-based methods for VS30 estimation. Using this database, we develop two proxy-based VS30 estimation procedures inspired by their successful implementation elsewhere: (1) a hybrid geology-slope approach that provides the natural log mean and standard deviation of VS30 for 18 geologic groups representative of the regional geology, including glaciation and volcanism; and (2) a geomorphic terrain-based method that provides VS30 moments for 16 global categories, 13 of which are well populated in the PNW. Of these, we recommend use of the hybrid geology-slope proxy over the terrain proxy, due to smaller dispersion of residuals and strong correlation between predictions of the two proxies. Based on these findings, we provide estimates of natural log means and standard deviations of VS30 for NGA-Sub recording stations in Ⓔ the electronic supplement to this article. In the Ⓔ electronic supplement, we also provide the estimates of basin depths (vertical depth to various VS horizons) using available 3D velocity models for the region.},

The method is based on the assumption that the power spectrum of coda waves of a local earthquake is only a function of time measured from the earthquake origin time and independent of distance and details of wave path to the station. Evidence supporting this assumption is presented, using the data on aftershocks of the Parkfield earthquakes of June 28, 1966. A simple statistical model of the wave medium that accounts for the observations on the coda is proposed. By applying the method to many Parkfield aftershocks, the relation between the seismic moment M0 and local magnitude ML is determined as log M0 (dyne cm) = 15.8 + 1.5ML. The size of a microearthquake with magnitude zero is estimated as 10×10 meters.},

  abstract = {This is a review of the current state of the art in characterizing effects of local geology on ground motion. A new horizon is clear in this aspect of strong motion studies. Non-linear amplification at sediment sites appears to be more pervasive than seismologists used to think. Several recent observations about the weak motion and the strong motion suggest that the non-linear amplification at sediment sites may be very common. First, on average, the amplification is always greater at the younger sediment sites for all frequencies up to 12 Hz, in the case of weak motion; while the relation is reversed for frequencies higher than 5 Hz, in the case of strong motion. Secondly, the application of the amplification factor determined from weak motion overestimates significantly the strong motion at sediment sites observed during the Loma Prieta earthquake within the epicentral distance of about 50 km. Thirdly, the variance of peak ground acceleration around the mean curve decreases with the increasing earthquake magnitude. Finally, the above non-linear effects are expected from geotechnical studies both in the magnitude of departure from the linear prediction and in the threshold acceleration level beyond which the non-linearity begins.},

  abstract = {Coda waves from small local earthquakes are interpreted as backscattering waves from numerous heterogeneities distributed uniformly in the earth's crust. Two extreme models of the wave medium that account for the observations on the coda are proposed. In the single backscattering model the scattering is considered to be a weak process, and the loss of seismic energy by scattering is neglected. In the diffusion model the seismic energy transfer is considered as a diffusion process. Both models lead to similar formulas that allow an accurate separation of the effect of earthquake source from the effects of scattering and attenuation on the coda spectra. A unique difference was found in the scaling law of earthquake source spectra between central California and western Japan, which may be attributed to the difference in inhomogeneity length of the earth's crust. The Q of coda waves in the two regions is strongly frequency dependent with values increasing from 50–200 at 1 Hz to about 1000–2000 at 20 Hz. This observation is interpreted as a combined effect of variation of Q with depth and frequency-dependent composition of coda waves described below. The turbidity coefficient of the lithosphere required at 1 Hz to explain the observed coda as body wave scattering is orders of magnitude greater than previously known values such as those obtained by Aki (1973) and Capon (1974) under the Montana Lasa from the amplitude and phase fluctuations of teleseismic P waves. From the high attenuation and turbidity obtained at this frequency we conclude that at around 1 Hz the coda is made of backscattering surface waves from heterogeneities in the shallow, low-Q lithosphere. The high Q observed for the coda at frequencies higher than 10 Hz, on the other hand, eliminates the possibility that these waves are backscattering surface waves. We conclude that at these high frequencies the coda must be made of backscattering body waves from heterogeneities in the deep lithosphere. The low turbidities found for deep earthquake sources under western Japan are consistent with this model of coda wave generation.},

  abstract = {In numerical modeling of seismic wave propagation in the earth, we encounter two important issues: the free surface and the topography of the surface (i.e. irregularities). In this study, we develop a 2D finite difference solver for the elastic wave equation that combines a 4th- order ADER scheme (Arbitrary high-order accuracy using DERivatives), which is widely used in aeroacoustics, with the characteristic variable method at the free surface boundary. The idea is to treat the free surface boundary explicitly by using ghost values of the solution for points beyond the free surface to impose the physical boundary condition. The method is based on the velocity-stress formulation. The ultimate goal is to develop a numerical solver for the elastic wave equation that is stable, accurate and computationally efficient. The solver treats smooth arbitrary-shaped boundaries as simple plane boundaries. The computational cost added by treating the topography is negligible compared to flat free surface because only a small number of grid points near the boundary need to be computed. In the presence of topography, using 10 grid points per shortest shear-wavelength, the solver yields accurate results. Benchmark numerical tests using several complex models that are solved by our method and other independent accurate methods show an excellent agreement, confirming the validity of the method for modeling elastic waves with an irregular free surface.},

  abstract = {Local  site effects have an enormous influence on the character of ground motions. Currently, soil categories and site factors used in building codes for seismic design are generally based on, or at least correlated with, the seismic velocity of the surface layer. We note, however, that the upper 30 m (a typical depth of investigation) would almost never represent more than 1\% of the distance from the source; 0.1\% to 0.2\% would be more typical of situations where motion is damaging. We investigate the influence of this thin skin on the high-frequency properties of seismograms. We examine properties of seismograms consisting of vertically propagating S waves through an arbitrarily complex stack of flat, solid, elastic layers, where the properties of the lowermost layer (taken at 5 km depth) and a surface layer (thickness 30 m) are constrained. Input at the bottom of the stack is an impulse. We find that the character of the seismograms, and the peak spectral frequencies, are strongly influenced by the properties of the intervening layers. However, for infinite Q, the integral of amplitude squared at the surface (which determines energy if the input and output are regarded as velocity, or Arias intensity if the input and output are regarded as acceleration) is independent of the intervening layers. Also, the peak amplitude of the seismogram at the surface is relatively independent of the intervening properties. For finite, frequency-independent Q, the integral of amplitude squared and peak amplitude decrease as t* increases. There is some scatter that depends on the intervening layers, but it is surprisingly small.These  calculations suggest that the surficial geology has a greater influence on ground motions than might be expected based on its thickness alone. They suggest that variable influences of Q along the entire path have a comparable importance for predictions of ground motions. Finally, they suggest that detailed characterization of deeper velocity structure in regions where a 1D model is appropriate gives only a limited amount of added information. Based on our 1D numerical results, we propose a new method to characterize these properties as site factors that could be used in building codes. Full three-dimensional synthetics are tested and give a similar conclusion.},

  abstract = {To develop credibility of synthetic seismograms for engineering applications, there is a need for a quantitative score that can be used to characterize the how well the synthetic matches the statistical characteristics of observed records. Recognizing that strong motion is a very complex time series and any measure that relies on a single parameter for the comparison is seriously incomplete, this paper examines use of a suite of measurements. To be specific, we score seismograms that have been filtered into up to ten narrow pass-bands. Each frequency band is scored on ten different characteristics. The characteristics scored are the peak acceleration, peak velocity, peak displacement, Arias intensity, the integral of velocity squared, Fourier spectrum and acceleration response spectrum on a frequency-by-frequency basis, the shape of the normalized integrals of acceleration and velocity squared, and the cross correlation. Each characteristic is compared on a scale from 0 to 10, with 10 giving perfect agreement. Scores for each parameter are averaged to yield an overall quality of fit. A score below 4 is a poor fit, a score of 4-6 is a fair fit, a score of 6 to 8 is a good fit, and a score over 8 is an excellent fit. One horizontal component of an actual seismogram typically fits the other horizontal component in the “good” range. The method is applied to a blind prediction of ground motions at a station 3 km from the fault in the M7.9 Denali Fault, Alaska, earthquake of November 3, 2002.},

  abstract = {Physical limits on possible maximum ground motion at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, the designated site of a high-level radioactive waste repository, are set by the shear stress available in the seismogenic depth of the crust and by limits on stress change that can propagate through the medium. We find in dynamic deterministic 2D calculations that maximum possible horizontal peak ground velocity (PGV) at the underground repository site is 3.6 m/sec, which is smaller than the mean PGV predicted by the probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) at annual exceedance probabilities less than 10-6 per year. The physical limit on vertical PGV, 5.7 m/sec, arises from supershear rupture and is larger than that from the PSHA down to 10-8 per year. In addition to these physical limits, we also calculate the maximum ground motion subject to the constraint of known fault slip at the surface, as inferred from paleoseismic studies. Using a published probabilistic fault displacement hazard curve, these calculations provide a probabilistic hazard curve for horizontal PGV that is lower than that from the PSHA. In all cases the maximum ground motion at the repository site is found by maximizing constructive interference of signals from the rupture front, for physically realizable rupture velocity, from all parts of the fault. Vertical PGV is maximized for ruptures propagating near the P-wave speed, and horizontal PGV is maximized for ruptures propagating near the Rayleigh-wave speed. Yielding in shear with a Mohr–Coulomb yield condition reduces ground motion only a modest amount in events with supershear rupture velocity, because ground motion consists primarily of P waves in that case. The possibility of compaction of the porous unsaturated tuffs at the higher ground-motion levels is another attenuating mechanism that needs to be investigated.},

We test three 3D structural models built independently in various studies. First aftershock simulations are carried out. The model based on 3D tomography yields correct body waves in the near field, but later phases are imperfectly reproduced due to the lack of shallow sediment layers; other models based on various 1D/2D profiles and geological interpretation provide good site responses but generate seismic phases that may be shifted from those actually observed. Next, for the mainshock simulations, we adopt two different finite source models that differ in the near-field ground motion, especially above the fault plane (but under the sea) and then along the coastline. Each model is found to be calibrated differently for the given stations. For engineering purposes, the variations observed in simulated ground motion are significant, but for seismological purposes, additional parameter calibrations would be possible for such a complex 3D case.},

  abstract = {The Garner Valley downhole array (GVDA) in southern California (33°41.60'N, 116°40.20'W) is a five-element array of three-component, dual-gain force balance accelerometers that are capable of measuring accelerations from 3 × 10 -6 to 2.0 g over a frequency range from 0.0 to 100 Hz. The accelerometers are placed at depths of 0, 6, 15, 22, and 220 m. The lithostratigraphy is 19 m of soil overlying a 24-m layer of weathered granite below which is granite (tonalite). The array, only 7 km from the San Jacinto fault, is located at the northern end of the Anza seismic gap on the San Jacinto fault, where an M 6.5 or greater earthquake can be expected. It is only 35 km from the Indio segment of the San Andreas fault, which last ruptured with an M {$>$} 8 earthquake around 1700 A.D. From its installation in July 1989 through July 1991, GVDA has recorded 280 earthquakes with magnitudes ranging from 1.2 to 4.7 and epicentral distances ranging from from 0 to 110 km. The maximum acceleration recorded was 89 c m / s e c 2 from an M L 4.2 earthquake 15.8 km (hypocentral distance) from GVDA. The average amplification of the apparent seismic moment between 220-m depth and the surface is about 13 for over five orders of magnitude in the size of the recorded earthquakes. The spectral ratio 0 / 220 of horizontal acceleration amplitude spectrum shows a mean amplification of about 10 for the frequency range of 2.0 to 30 Hz for 17 events. Resonance peaks exist at about 1.7, 3.0, and 12.0 Hz where the spectral ratio 0/220 is nearly 40. Analysis of the acceleration spectra of two specific earthquakes that have nearly the same hypocenter but with different magnitudes, M 4.2 and 2.5, shows that the weathered granite zone, beneath the soil, strongly attenuates the spectral amplitudes for frequencies greater than 40 Hz. The impedance of the soil relative to the weathered granite amplifies all frequencies by about a factor of 3, leading to spectral levels that are greater at the surface than at 22-m depth, near the top of the weathered granite. The acceleration spectra at each depth show resonant peaks at the same frequencies. The spectra at each depth are well correlated for both earthquakes. The acceleration spectrum at 220 m is nearly constant for frequencies less than 60 Hz, which implies that there is little or no attenuation.},

  abstract = {The effect of inclined shear waves on the seismic response of a steep bluff is analyzed using generalized consistent transmitting boundaries. The results of the frequency-domain analysis of a stepped half-space subjected to incident shear waves inclined from 0° to 30° show that the motion at the crest of the slope is amplified for waves traveling into the slope and attenuated for waves traveling away from the slope, as compared to the motion in the free field behind the crest of the slope. This amplification can be as much as twice that observed for vertically propagating waves. A time-domain analysis of bluffs at Seacliff State Beach, California, is used to estimate the effect of topography using realistic conditions, taking into account wave inclination and site effects. The analysis of the site shows that although topographic amplification does in fact nearly double the amplitude of the motion in some cases, this amplification is offset by reduced site amplification and by wave splitting at material interfaces. Thus, the actual peak acceleration occurring at the crest of the slope changes little with incident angle as compared to the amplification of the free-field motion and actually decreases in many cases. Though a more general study is recommended, these results suggest that wave orientation and inclination substantially increase topographic amplification; however, it may be adequate to only account for vertically propagating waves for site response and slope stability analyses where only the magnitude of acceleration is considered.},

To explore whether the particular topographic relief and/or the local soil conditions have contributed to the observed concentration and non-uniform damage distribution within a 300-m zone from the canyon crest, we conduct finite-element analyses in one and two dimensions, using Ricker wavelets and six realistic accelerograms as excitation. The nonlinear soil response is simulated in the time-domain using a hyperbolic stress-strain model, and also approximated using a modified equivalent-linear algorithm; results obtained by means of the two methods are discussed in detail. Our simulations show that topographic effects are substantial only within about 50 m from the canyon ridge, materializing primarily because of the presence of relatively soft soil layers near the surface of the profile. We then introduce the concept of two-dimensional/one-dimensional response spectral ratio to describe the effects of topography as a function of local soil conditions, and suggest a frequency- and location-dependent topographic aggravation factor to be introduced for the modification of design spectra in a seismic code.},

The sites are within 0.4 km of Anza network surface stations and have three-component seismometers deployed at 300 m depth, at 150 m depth, and at the surface. Downhole horizontal seismometers can be oriented to an accuracy of about 5° using regional and near-regional initial P-wave particle motions.Shear waves recorded downhole at the KNW-BH indicate that the strong alignment of initial S-wave particle motions previously observed at the (surface) KNW Anza site (KNW-AZ) is not generated in the near-surface weathered layer. The KNW-BH surface instrument, which sits atop a highly weathered zone, displays a significantly different (≈ 20°) initial S-wave polarization direction from that observed downhole and at KNW-AZ, which is bolted to an outcrop. Although downhole initial shear-wave particle motion directions are consistent with a shear-wave splitting hypothesis, observations of orthogonally polarized slow shear waves are generally elusive, even in seismograms recorded at 300 m. A cross-correlation measure of the apparent relative velocities of Sfast and Sslow horizontally polarized S waves suggests shallow shear-wave anisotropy, consistent with the observed initial S-wave particle motion direction, of 2.3 ± 1.7 per cent between 300 and 150 m and 7.5 ± 3.5 per cent between 150 and 0 m.},

The data base is comprised of over 1000 vertical-component Fourier spectra, from earthquakes of magnitude 3 to 7 at distances from 10 to 500 km. Regression analyses determine the shape and coefficients of the regional attenuation curve and source spectra for 68 earthquakes. Seismic moment and stress drop are inferred from the amplitudes of the source spectra.Shallow (h \&lt; 10 km) earthquakes have an attenuation curve with a complex shape, exhibiting significant flattening (no apparent geometric spreading) in the distance range from 75 to 230 km; this shape is probably a result of strong reflected phases from mid-crustal discontinuities and the subducting slab. Events within the subducting slab and the lower crust exhibit a simple R−1 attenuation curve. The anelastic attenuation coefficient for the region as a whole is given by Q = 380f0.39.The duration of motion for each WCTN record is determined as the value that yields the observed relationship between time-domain and spectral-domain amplitudes, according to random process theory. These durations are approximately constant within 50 km of the source, then increase with distance as 0.07R.The high-frequency ground motions from Cascadia earthquakes are relatively weak. Cascadia source spectra are characterized by an average Brune stress drop of about 30 bars. This is significantly lower than the average California stress drop of 70 to 100 bars, and dramatically lower than the average eastern stress drop of 150 to 200 bars. It is concluded that there are significant regional variations in source parameters. Hazard estimates for the Cascadia region based on California groundmotion relations may be overly conservative.},

  abstract = {New earthquake ground-motion relations for hard-rock and soil sites in eastern North America (ENA), including estimates of their aleatory uncertainty (variability) have been developed based on a stochastic finite-fault model. The model incorporates new information obtained from ENA seismographic data gathered over the past 10 years, including three-component broadband data that provide new information on ENA source and path effects. Our new prediction equations are similar to the previous ground-motion prediction equations of Atkinson and Boore (1995), which were based on a stochastic point-source model. The main difference is that high-frequency amplitudes (f Ն 5 Hz) are less than previously predicted (by about a factor of 1.6 within 100 km), because of a slightly lower average stress parameter (140 bars versus 180 bars) and a steeper near-source attenuation. At frequencies less than 5 Hz, the predicted ground motions from the new equations are generally within 25\% of those predicted by Atkinson and Boore (1995). The prediction equations agree well with available ENA ground-motion data as evidenced by near-zero average residuals (within a factor of 1.2) for all frequencies, and the lack of any significant residual trends with distance. However, there is a tendency to positive residuals for moderate events at high frequencies in the distance range from 30 to 100 km (by as much as a factor of 2). This indicates epistemic uncertainty in the prediction model. The positive residuals for moderate events at Ͻ100 km could be eliminated by an increased stress parameter, at the cost of producing negative residuals in other magnitude-distance ranges; adjustment factors to the equations are provided that may be used to model this effect.},

  abstract = {Blind prediction experiments have consistently shown that dynamic soil models rarely reproduce observed behavior. We hypothesize that a common reason for the poor performance of existing site response models is that the standard assumptions (one-dimensional vertically-propagating plane shear waves in layered media (SH1D)) do not adequately represent the complexity of site response behavior in many cases. We use weak motions from vertical seismic arrays to characterize sites in terms of the complexity of the site response. We compare empirical and theoretical SH1D transfer functions at sites from a broad range of geologic environments. We identify complexity from inter-event variability and misfit to the SH1D response. For simple SH1D sites, we examine nonlinear soil behavior. For complex sites, we illustrate how site complexities such as soil profile uncertainty, spatial heterogeneity, and soil nonlinearity can explain the observed deviations from the SH1D model. Through examples drawn from the Kiban-Kyoshin network (KiK-net) in Japan, we identify sites that follow the SH1D assumptions and are therefore ideal for calibrating nonlinear constitutive models in a SH1D framework, as well as sites that are better for investigating complex site effects.},

We target large sedimentary basins with contrasts in wavelengths of over an order of magnitude. Regular grid methods prove intractable for such problems. We overcome the problem of multiple physical scales by using unstructured finite elements on locally-resolved Delaunay triangulations derived from octree-based grids. The extremely large mesh sizes require special mesh generation techniques. Despite the method's multiresolution capability, large problem sizes necessitate the use of distributed memory parallel supercomputers to solve the elastic wave propagation problem. We have developed a system that helps automate the task of writing efficient portable unstructured mesh solvers for distributed memory parallel supercomputers. The numerical methodology and software system have been used to simulate the seismic response of the San Fernando Valley in Southern California to an aftershock of the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. We report on parallel performance on the Cray T3D for several models of the basin ranging in size from 35 000 to 77 million tetrahedra.

  abstract = {The scope of this work is to examine the influence of the uncertainty in soil modeling on numerical ground response estimates through a comprehensive sensitivity analysis. This allows identification of those parameters with the largest effect on both soil amplification (quantified here by a frequency-independent factor, F               a               ) and fundamental frequency, f               0               . Although extensively examined in previous articles, the effect of the input motion is also analyzed. The uncertainty affecting the shear wave velocity ( V               S               ) profile was found to be the factor contributing most to the uncertainty of both F               a               and f               0               . The soil thickness was also found to play a key role, particularly in those cases where bedrock depth is unknown or largely uncertain. Although of secondary importance compared to the effect of V               S               on F               a               and f               0               , the influence of the input motion cannot be neglected; rather it becomes predominant with regard to the uncertainty affecting frequency-dependent shaking parameters.},

  abstract = {The Aki-Larner technique is used to perform, in both the time and frequency domains, an analysis of the effects of two-dimensional elevated topography on ground motion. Incident plane SH-, SV- and P-waves are considered and the respective influences of surface geometry, elastic parameters and the incident wave characteristics, as long as they remain within the limits of applicability of the A-L technique, are investigated in some detail.Besides the well-known amplification/deamplfication effect related to the surface curvature, wave scattering phenomena on the convex parts of the surface are shown to contribute significantly to the disturbances in the displacement field around the topographic structure. These scattered waves are SH in the case of incident SH-waves, and mainly Rayleigh waves in the P case, while both Rayleigh and horizontal P-waves, sometimes of large amplitude, develop in the SV case. The frequency dependence of this scattering, though complex, seems to be mainly controlled by the horizontal scale of the topographic structure. The parameter study points out the regular and intuitive behaviour of this wave scattering in both SH and P cases, while it exhibits a puzzling complexity for incident SV-waves, which is interpreted as resulting from the importance of the S-P reflections on mountain slopes in that case.As to the ground motion, some general features may be pointed out. The amplification on mountain tops, which is systematically greater for incident S-waves than for P-waves, generally decreases as the average slope decreases or as the angle of incidence increases. Mountain slopes undergo either amplification or deamplification depending on site location, frequency and incidence angle, but they always undergo strong differential motion due to the lateral propagation of the scattered waves and their interference with the primary wave. Finally, all these effects may be greatly enhanced in the case of complex topographies, which moreover give rise to a significant prolongation of ground motion because of the large number of scattered waves.},

  abstract = {Wave propagation simulation, as an essential part of many algorithms in seismic exploration, is associated with high computational cost. Reduced order modelling (ROM) is a known technique in many different applications that can reduce the computational cost of simulation by employing an approximation of the model parameters. ROM can be carried out using different algorithms. The method proposed in this work is based on using the most important mode shapes of the model, which can be computed by an efficient numerical method. The numerical accuracy and computational performance of the proposed method were investigated over a simple synthetic velocity model and a portion of the SEG/EAGE velocity model. Different boundary conditions were discussed, and among them the random boundary condition had higher performance for applications like reverse time migration (RTM). The capability of the proposed method for RTM was evaluated and confirmed by the synthetic velocity model of SEG/EAGE. The results showed that the proposed ROM method, compared with the conventional finite element method (FEM), can decrease the computational cost of wave propagation modelling for applications with many simulations like the reverse time migration. Depending on the number of simulations, the proposed method can increase the computational efficiency by several orders of magnitudes.},

  abstract = {In recent years there has been a growing realization that geological media vary over a broad scale range. As such heterogeneity cannot be described in a deterministic way, a parallel growth in stochastic analyses of geological/geophysical data has emerged. The stochastic description of these media is usually through some form of correlation function, of which the von Karman is the most widely employed. Using this form, media can be described in terms of a characteristic scale size (or correlation length), L and a coloured scaling regime, with scaling described by H, the Hurst exponent. Beyond the correlation length, the material follows a white noise spectrum where material average properties dominate, below the correlation length local heterogeneity dominates. Hence, the correlation length is a fundamental parameter in a range of geodynamical problems. In situ information about stochastic properties of deep crustal rocks can be obtained from the statistical analysis of reflection seismic data. Typical correlation distances within the crust are found to be several hundred metres. Here we show that correlation distances derived from reflection seismic data are strongly influenced by the spectral content of the source. In particular we conclude that there is no reliable evidence for hundred metre scale correlation lengths for crustal heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {Geotechnical models consistently indicate that the stress-strain relationship of soils is nonlinear and hysteretic, especially at shear strains larger than - 1 0 - 5 to 10 .4 . Nonlinear effects, such as an increase in damping and reduction in shearwave velocity as excitation strength increases, are commonly recognized in the dynamic loading of soils. On the other hand, these effects are usually ignored in seismological models of ground-motion prediction because of the lack of compelling corroborative evidence from strong-motion observations. The situation is being changed by recently obtained data. Explicit evidence of strong-motion deamplification, accompanied by changes in resonant frequencies, are found in the data from the 1985 Michoacan, Mexico, and the 1989 Loma Prieta, California, earthquakes, the events recorded by the vertical and surface accelerograph arrays in Taiwan, as well as a number of other events throughout the world. Evidence of nonlinear behavior becomes apparent beyond a threshold acceleration of -100 to 200 gal. Nonlinearity is considerable in cohesionless soil but may be negligible in stiff soils. The findings of recent years indicate that nonlinear site effects are more common than previously recognized in strong-motion seismology.},

  abstract = {The basic elements of probabilistic seismic-hazard analysis (psha) were established almost four decades ago and psha has now become the most widely  used approach for estimating seismic-design loads. Although the use of psha is  widespread, considerable confusion remains regarding the details of how the calculations  should be performed. This situation is largely a result of the way the discipline  of psha evolved through a series of articles, reports, and software packages. This  article demonstrates that the feature of psha about which there is perhaps the greatest  degree of misunderstanding is the treatment of the aleatory variability in ground- motion prediction equations, which exerts a very pronounced influence on the calculated  hazard. Probabilistic hazard studies performed in recent years have frequently  resulted in appreciably higher design ground motions than had been obtained in  previous assessments carried out in the 1970s and 1980s, often sparking controversial  debate. Although several factors may contribute to the higher estimates of seismic  hazard in modern studies, the main reason for these increases is that in the earlier  studies the ground-motion variability was either completely neglected or treated in  a way that artificially reduced its influence on the hazard estimates.},

One of the objectives of this experiment is to estimate site response and study wave propagation as the energy travels from the bedrock underneath the site up through the soil column. The GVDA velocity structure is studied by computing synthetic accelerograms for a small event located at an epicentral distance of 10 km. These synthetics simulate well the data recorded at the borehole stations. In addition, theoretical transfer functions are calculated using the obtained velocity model and compare well with the empirical transfer functions from 54 recorded events. It is also observed that the downgoing wave effect is predominant in the first 87 m and is strongly reduced at depth. Using the velocity structure at GVDA and the transfer function results, it has also been possible to develop a simple method to compute the incident wave field, which is needed in nonlinear site response for instance.},

  abstract = {Seismologists acknowledged nonlinear site response during strong motion in the aftermath of the Loma Prieta earthquake. Yet, it is the earthquake engineering community that conducts exclusively most nonlinear studies in practice. These are performed either by using linear-equivalent approximations or using complex constitute models that require a detailed soil characterization. Indeed, the problem of estimating nonlinear site response is the number of parameters needed to describe the dynamic material properties. For this reason, the majority of nonlinear analyses remain to one-dimensional computations. The well-recorded Mw9 Tohoku earthquake of March 11, 2011 shows widespread nonlinear effects on stations close to the rupture, even at sites having Vs30 larger than 400-600 m/s. Sites having lower values of Vs30 showed cyclic mobility and liquefaction. This event shows that if we want to correctly assess the ground motion for future large earthquakes, large-scale nonlinear analyses are needed. These observations represent a constraint when developing nonlinear constitutive models as well as a challenge for numerical computations. Furthermore, this mega-earthquake shows the need to team together seismologists and engineers because we need simple, yet robust, soil models able to reproduce these observations with few parameters than can be used in numerical predictions of near-field ground motion that include nonlinear site effects.},

This suggests strong nonlinear site response at these stations.

This study analyzes data, recorded on 31 three-component stations, from 38 aftershocks ranging from M 3.0 to M 5.1, and depths from 0.2 to 19 km. Site responses from the 31 stations are estimated from coda waves, S waves, and ratios of horizontal to vertical (H/V) recordings. For the coda and the S waves, site response is estimated using both direct spectral ratios and a generalized inversion scheme. Results from the inversions indicate that the effect of Qs can be significant, especially at high frequencies. Site amplifications estimated from the coda of the vertical and horizontal components can be significantly different from each other, depending on the choice of the reference site. The difference is reduced when an average of six rock sites is used as a reference site. In addition, when using this multi-reference site, the coda amplification from rock sites is usually within a factor of 2 of the amplification determined from the direct spectral ratios and the inversion of the S waves. However, for nonrock sites, the coda amplification can be larger by a factor of 2 or more when compared with the amplification estimated from the direct spectral ratios and the inversion of the S waves. The H/V method for estimating site response is found to extract the same predominant peaks as the direct spectral ratio and the inversion methods. The amplifications determined from the HIV method are, however, different from the amplifications determined from the other methods. Finally, the stations were grouped into classes based on two different classifications, general geology and a more detailed classification using a quaternary geology map for the Los Angeles and San Fernando areas. Average site-response estimates using the site characterization based on the detailed geology show better correlation between amplification and surface geology than the general geology classification.},

The equations were derived from a global database with M 3.0–7.9 events. We derived equations for the primary M- and distance-dependence of the IMs after fixing the VS30-based nonlinear site term from a parallel NGA-West2 study. We then evaluated additional effects using mixed effects residuals analysis, which revealed no trends with source depth over the M range of interest, indistinct Class 1 and 2 event IMs, and basin depth effects that increase and decrease long-period IMs for depths larger and smaller, respectively, than means from regional VS30-depth relations. Our aleatory variability model captures decreasing between-event variability with M, as well as within-event variability that increases or decreases with M depending on period, increases with distance, and decreases for soft sites.},

  abstract = {Recent measurements of peak P-wave amplitudes on World Wide Standardized Seismographic Network short-period instruments by Houston and Kanamori (1986) provided the opportunity to investigate source radiation from great earthquakes at higher frequencies than have previously been available. The dependence on moment magnitude (M) of the amplitude measurements (A) and the dominant period (T) in the P-wave seismograms are compared to predictions from several source-scaling relations. For all of the relations, the radiated energy was assumed to be randomly distributed over a duration proportional to the inverse corner frequency. An ω-square source-scaling relation with a constant stress parameter of 50 bars gives a good fit to both observed quantities (A and T) for earthquakes up to M 9.5. This model, with the same stress parameter, also fits peak acceleration and peak velocity data for earthquakes with moment magnitude as low as 0.5. Predictions using the source spectra derived by Gusev (1983), which are representative of several published relations featuring regions of reduced spectral decay after an initial ω−2 attenuation beyond the corner frequency, do not fit the various high-frequency observations quite as well as do those using the ω-square model, although the differences between the predicted motions are generally within a factor of 2 to 3. Although the ω-square model successfully predicts a wide variety of time-domain measures over an extraordinary magnitude range, it fails to fit the Ms, M correlation for large earthquakes; Gusev's spectral scaling relation, on the other hand, fits this correlation, but was constrained in advance to do so. This failure of the ω-square model is of little practical concern, occurring as it does at periods longer than those of usual engineering importance. An ω-cube model fails completely to explain the seismic moment dependence of the observations.},

  abstract = {Seismic shear-wave velocity as a function of depth for generic rock sites has been estimated from borehole data and studies of crustal velocities, and these velocities have been used to compute frequency-dependent amplifications for zero attenuation for use in simulations of strong ground motion. We define a generic rock site as one whose velocity at shallow depths equals the average of those from the rock sites sampled by the borehole data. Most of the boreholes are in populated areas; for that reason, the rock sites sampled are of particular engineering significance. We consider two generic rock sites: rock, corresponding to the bulk of the borehole data, and very hard rock, such as is found in glaciated regions in large areas of eastern North America or in portions of western North America. The amplifications on rock sites can be in excess of 3.5 at high frequencies, in contrast to the amplifications of less than 1.2 on very hard rock sites. The consideration of unattenuated amplification alone is computationally convenient, but what matters for ground-motion estimation is the combined effect of amplification and attenuation. For reasonable values of the attenuation parameter κ0, the combined effect of attenuation and amplification for rock sites peaks between about 2 and 5 Hz with a maximum level of less than 1.8. The combined effect is about a factor of 1.5 at 1 Hz and is less than unity for frequencies in the range of 10 to 20 Hz (depending on κ0).Using these amplifications, we find provisional values of about Δσ = 70 bars and κ0 = 0.035 sec for rock sites in western North America by fitting our empirically determined response spectra for an M 6.5 event to simulated values.The borehole data yield shear velocities (V30) of 618 and 306 m/sec for “rock” and “soil” sites, respectively, when averaged over the upper 30 m. From this, we recommend that V30 equals 620 and 310 m/sec for applications requiring the average velocity for rock and soil sites in western North America.By combining the amplifications for rock sites and the site factors obtained from our analysis of strong-motion data, we derive amplifications for sites with V30 = 520 m/sec (NEHRP class C, corresponding to a mix of rock and soil sites) and V30 = 310 and 255 m/sec (average soil and NEHRP class D sites, respectively). For the average soil site, the combined effect of amplification and attenuation exceeds a factor of 2.0 for frequencies between 0.4 and about 4 Hz, with a peak site effect of 2.4; the peak of the NEHRP class D site effect is 2.7.},

The method estimates the slownesses in a single inversion of the travel-times from all receiver depths and accounts for refractions at layer boundaries. The number and location of layer interfaces in the model can be selected based on lithologic changes or linear trends in the travel-time data. The interfaces based on linear trends in the data can be picked manually or by an automated algorithm. We illustrate the method with example sites for which geologic descriptions of the subsurface materials and independent slowness measurements are available. At each site we present slowness models that result from different interpretations of the data. The examples were carefully selected to address the reliability of interface-selection and the ability of the inversion to identify thin layers, large slowness contrasts, and slowness gradients. Additionally, we compare the models in terms of ground-motion amplification. These plots illustrate the sensitivity of site amplifications to the uncertainties in the slowness model. We show that one-dimensional site amplifications are insensitive to thin layers in the slowness models; although slowness is variable over short ranges of depth, this variability has little affect on ground-motion amplification at frequencies up to 5 Hz.},

The recordings show marked amplitude variations which are related consistently to the geologic setting of the recording site. For sites underlain by a layer of younger bay mud or artificial fill, maximum horizontal ground velocities generally increased with thickness of the layer and were as much as ten times greater than those recorded on nearby bedrock. The maximum vertical velocities for these sites were between 1 and 3.5 times greater. Spectral amplification curves clearly define a "dominant ground period" of about 1 second for sites underlain by younger bay mud. For sites underlain by older, more consolidated sediments, no clearly defined "dominant ground period" was found. Maximum ground velocities for the older bay sediment sites were about twice those recorded on bedrock.},

  abstract = {The Northridge, California, earthquake that strongly shook the city of Los Angeles in January 1994, produced one of the highest ground accelerations ever recorded in an earthquake, at a site located on top of a small hill in Tarzana, about 6 km south of the epicenter. The subsequent study of aftershock recordings obtained by a dense seismic array deployed on the hill a few days after the earthquake showed the existence of a strong amplification at stations located at the top of the hill, relative to stations near the base (Spudich et al., 1996). Resonances and polarization rotations were also observed. We investigate in this study the role that the topography of the site played on the observed ground motions and accelerations. To this aim, we perform numerical simulations and study the response of the three-dimensional topography of the site to incident shear waves polarized in different directions. The method used is a boundary integral equation scheme in which the Green's functions are calculated by the discrete wavenumber method. The results obtained show that the topography of the site, though quite gentle (the hill is less than 20-m high), strongly affects the ground motions in the frequency range between 2 and 15 Hz. Many of the observed characteristics of the seismic response at Tarzana are explained in part by its topography: the consistent amplification of ground motion at and near the top of the hill, the directional seismic response of the hill that results in a strong amplification of the ground motion transverse to the direction of elongation of the hill, the existence of a fundamental transverse oscillatory resonance mode of the hill at 3 to 5 Hz, the rotation of the polarization of ground motion, and the spatial variation of amplification over the hill at the fundamental resonance mode. The seismic response of the topography, however, does not fully explain the amplitude of the effects observed. The three-dimensional geological structure of the site must in some way amplify the effect of the topography to produce the observed seismic response. In spite of not being as strong as the observed effect, the topographic effect of the site is considerable. The ground motion is amplified by factors ranging from 30\% to 100\% at some locations in the frequency range from 2 to 15 Hz. Rapid spatial variations of ground-shaking intensities can take place over distance scales of a few tens of meters at high frequency. Finally, the results of the simulation indicate that the topography of the site amplified the large east-west accelerations recorded there during the Northridge mainshock by 30\% to 40\%.},

The aim of the analyses is to explore the effects of slope geometry, predominant excitation frequency and duration, as well as of the dynamic soil properties on seismic ground motion in a parametric manner, and provide qualitative as well as quantitative insight to the phenomenon. Among the main conclusions of this study is that this kind of topography may lead to intense amplification or de-amplification variability at neighboring (within a few tens of meters) points behind the crest of the slope, especially for high frequency excitations. Nevertheless, a general trend of amplification near the crest and de-amplification near the toe of the slope seems to hold for the horizontal motion. As a result of these two findings, it becomes evident that reliable field evidence of slope topography aggravation is extremely difficult to establish. Furthermore, this study highlights the generation of a parasitic vertical component of motion in the vicinity of the slope, due to wave reflections at the slope surface, that under certain preconditions may become as large as the horizontal. Criteria are established for deciding on the importance of topography effects, while approximate relations are provided for the preliminary evaluation of the topographic aggravation of seismic ground motion and the width of the affected zone behind the crest.},

  abstract = {The recent growth of seismic monitoring networks allows for systematic studies of local seismic effects at sites with pronounced topography. We applied a terrain classification method to identify such sites within Swiss and Japanese networks and compiled a data set of high-quality earthquake recordings. As a number of recent studies have found local effects to be directional at sites with strong topographic features, polarization analysis of particle motion was performed and azimuthally dependent resonant frequencies were estimated. The same procedure was also applied for available ambient vibration recordings. Moreover, average residuals with respect to ground motion prediction models for a reference bedrock were calculated to estimate the average amplification or deamplification for each station. On one hand, observed amplifications are found to be tightly linked with ground motion directionality as estimated by polarization analysis for both earthquake and ambient vibration recordings. On the other hand, we found no clear relation between local topographic features and observed amplification, so the local subsurface properties (i.e. shear wave velocity structure) seem to play the key role and not the geometry itself.},

The NGA-West2 database provides better constraints on magnitude scaling and attenuation of small-magnitude earthquakes, where our 2008 GMPE was known to be biased.

  abstract = {In many cases, in the seismic wave propagation modelling context, scales much smaller than the minimum wavelength are present in the earth model in which we wish to compute seismograms. For many numerical methods these small scales are a challenge leading to high numerical cost. The purpose of this paper is to understand and to build the effective medium and equations allowing to average the small scales of the original medium without losing the accuracy of the wavefield computation. In this paper, only the simple layered medium case is studied, leaving the general 3-D medium case for future work. To obtain such an effective medium and equations, we use high order two scale homogenization applied to the wave equation for layered media with rapid variation of elastic properties and density compared to the smallest wavelength of the wavefield. We show that the order 0 homogenization gives the result that was obtained by Backus in 1962. Order 0 homogenized models are transversely isotropic even though the original model is isotropic. It appears that order 0 is not enough to obtain surface waves with correct group and phase velocities and higher order homogenization terms up to two are often required. In many cases, the order one and two simply require to correct the boundary conditions of the wave equation to obtain an accurate solution, even for surface waves. We show how to extend the theory from the periodic case to the non-periodic case. Examples in periodic and non-periodic media are shown. The accuracy of the results obtained by homogenization is checked against the normal mode solution computed in the original medium and shows good agreement.},

Using frequency-dependent spectral ratios of aftershock data obtained from a temporarily established dense array, it is shown that there is substantial amplification of motions at the ridges of Canal Beagle. The data set constitutes the first such set depicting topographical amplification at a heavily populated region and correlates well with the damage distribution observed during the main event.Dense arrays established in Viña del Mar also yielded extensive data which are quantified to show that, in the range of frequencies of engineering interest, there was substantial amplification at different sites of different geological formations. To substantiate this, spectral ratios developed from the strong-motion records of the main event are used to show the extensive degree of amplification at an alluvial site as compared to a rock site. Similarly, spectral ratios developed from aftershocks recorded at comparable stations qualitatively confirm that the frequency ranges for which the amplification of motions occur are quite similar to those from strong-motion records. In case of weak motions, the denser arrays established temporarily as described herein can be used to identify the frequency ranges for which amplification occurs, to quantify the degree of frequency-dependent amplification and used in microzonation of closely spaced localities.},

  abstract = {A full time-domain solution for predicting earthquake ground motion based on the 1D viscoelastic shear-wave equation is presented. The derivation results in a time-domain equation in the form of an infinite impulse response filter. A solution in the time domain has several advantages including causality, direct modeling of impulsive and transient processes, and ease of inclusion of nonlinear soil behavior. The method is applicable to any arbitrarily layered silhouette presented as SH-wave velocity, damping coefficient, and mass density profiles for designated soil intervals. For nonlinear evaluations, an equivalent-linear formulation is incorporated and the standard modulus and damping degradation curves become part of the input set. Input motion can be either rock-outcrop or body-wave motions measured or estimated at the bottom of the geologic profile, and the output is the estimated ground motion time history. Application of the method to vertical array strong motion records from Garner Valley, and Wildlife Site, Calif., shows that predicted surface (and interval) ground motion is virtually identical to that measured. The differences between the results of linear and nonlinear analyses are negligible for most cases. A comparison of the time-domain model with SHAKE shows that SHAKE fails to accurately predict time histories in some situations, whereas the time-domain solution always yields satisfactory predicted surface ground motions.},

A map showing lateral velocity variations at a depth of approximately 10 km is presented. The results show a strong correlation with surface tectonic features. Clear velocity contrasts exist across the San Andreas, the San Jacinto, and the Garlock faults. The Mojave region has the slowest velocities while the Peninsula Ranges have the highest. The San Jacinto block has velocities intermediate between Mojave and Peninsula Range velocities, and also has early station delays. This may indicate that the San Jacinto block has overridden Mojave material on a shallow detachment surface. No velocity variations are found associated with the Transverse Ranges, which we interpret to mean that the surface batholithic rocks in this area do not extend to Pg depths.},

Using seismic events recorded by sensors buried at depth in the crystalline bedrock (220 m), in weathered crystalline rocks (22 m), and in sediments (15, 6, and 0 m), we analyze the S-wave vertical travel times and polarizations at different depths. Hodograms plotted for horizontal components at S onset exhibit a clear linear and constant polarization independent of both earthquake location and mechanism. This alignment varies with depth and is N 325 ° \_+ 13° at 220 m while N 25° + 20° at 22, 15, 6, and 0 m.

Studies conducted on this site concluded to a rock fabric anisotropy due to the alignment of minerals and/or microcracks along the lineation direction. (b) For the shallow ({$<$}220 m) propagation, we observe a N 0° + 20° fast-axis anisotropy with an 8 \_+ 2\% magnitude between 220 and 22 m. The associated Sfast-Sslow travel-time delays roughly correspond to half the dominant period of the signal, and the subsurface linear polarization is interpreted as a degenerated ellipse. The north \_+20° anisotropy fast axis coincides with the maximum horizontal compressive stress associated with the San Andreas fault system. The shallow anisotropy extension corresponds to slow velocities associated with altered granite. It suggests either a stress-induced anisotropy due to pore/crack deformation in an altered (e.g., hydrothermally) medium, or the superposition of two crystalline units having different lineation directions. These data show that in presence of slow 0- to 200-m subsurface layers, shallow anisotropy strongly affects the earthquake surface records in the usual frequency range, below 30 Hz, used in short-period seismology.},

  abstract = {Earthquakes are among the most complex terrestrial phenomena, and modeling of earthquake dynamics is one of the most challenging computational problems in science. Computational capabilities have advanced to a state where we can perform wavefield simulations for realistic three-dimensional earth models, and gain more insights into the earthquakes that threaten California and many areas of the world. The Southern California Earthquake Center initiated a major earthquake research program called TeraShake to perform physics-based numerical simulations of earthquake processes for large geographical regions, at high resolution, and for high frequencies. For a large scale simulation such as TeraShake, optimization problems tend to emerge that are not significant in smaller scale simulations. This involves both large parallel computation and also massive data management and visualization coordination. In this paper, we describe how we performed single-processor optimization of the TeraShake AWM application, optimization of the I/O handling, and optimization of initialization. We also look at the challenges presented by run-time data archive management and visualization. The improvements made to the TeraShake AWM code enabled execution on the 40k IBM Blue Gene processors and have created a community code that can be used by seismologists to perform petascale earthquake simulations.},

The computational demands of this program continue to increase rapidly as these researchers seek to perform physics-based numerical simulations of earthquake processes for larger meet the needs of this research program, a multiple-institution team coordinated by SCEC has integrated several scientific codes into a numerical modeling-based research tool we call the TeraShake computational platform (TSCP). A central component in the TSCP is a highly scalable earthquake wave propagation simulation program called the TeraShake anelastic wave propagation (TS-AWP) code. In this chapter, we describe how we extended an existing, stand-alone, wellvalidated, finite-difference, anelastic wave propagation modeling code into the highly scalable and widely used TS-AWP and then integrated this code into the TeraShake computational platform that provides end-to-end (initialization to analysis) research capabilities. We also describe the techniques used to enhance the TS-AWP parallel performance on TeraGrid supercomputers, as well as the TeraShake simulations phases including input preparation, run time, data archive management, and visualization. As a result of our efforts to improve its parallel efficiency, the TS-AWP has now shown highly efficient strong scaling on over 40K processors on IBM’s BlueGene/L Watson computer. In addition, the TSCP has developed into a computational system that is useful to many members of the SCEC community for performing large-scale earthquake simulations.},

L-7 instruments deployed at the crest and base of Kagel Mountain and Josephine Peak, California, recorded several aftershocks of the February 9, 1971, San Fernando earthquake. L-7 instruments deployed at the crest, middle, and base of Butler Mountain near Tonopah, Nevada, recorded the seismic signal generated by the cavity collapse following the Nevada Test Site detonation, ALGODONES. Frequency-dependent amplification of the motion at the crest relative to the motion at the base was observed at all three mountains. Factors as large as 30 in the frequency domain were seen at Kagel Mountain with lesser amounts at the other two locations. The three mountains are similar in shape, but different in size. The effect of shape is not clear. The smallest mountain amplified the motion in a narrow range of periods (peaking around 0.3 to 0.5 sec), the medium-size mountain showed amplification over a slightly broader range (peaking at periods of 0.4 to 0.5 sec), whereas the largest mountain showed less amplification, but it occurred over a broader range of periods. Effects in the time domain are generally comparable to, or less than, the effects in the frequency domain. The ratios of peak amplitudes (crest to base) are usually less than the spectral ratios. It is concluded that topography plays a significant role and is an important consideration in determining the seismic motion that a particular site receives.},

The model, implemented in the program FLAC3D, is a generalization of the 1-D parallel Iwan model, in which a number of components are connected in parallel, each component consisting of a linear elastic spring in series with a perfectly plastic slider. This simple arrangement produces non-linear stressstrain curves and hysteretic, Masing behavior for 1-D cyclic loading. Remarkably, this approach also works for 3-D cyclic loading. For generalization to 3-D, the constitutive model consists of a number of 3-D linear-elastic perfectly-plastic components with Drucker-Prager yield conditions. All components are subjected to the same strain, with the global stress defined as the average of the component stresses. This simple framework is straightforward to implement numerically, leading to a robust tool for analysis of general 3-D stress paths. The 3-D Masing behavior of the Iwan model is demonstrated for simultaneous cyclic loading in two and three orthogonal directions. The interaction between stress-strain loops in orthogonal directions is explored. Further work is required to validate the predicted interaction against laboratory experiments.},

  abstract = {Simulations of earthquake rupture on the southern San Andreas Fault (SAF) reveal large amplifications in the San Gabriel and Los Angeles Basins (SGB and LAB) apparently associated with long-range path effects. Geometrically similar excitation patterns can be recognized repeatedly in different SAF simulations (e.g. Love wave-like energy with predominant period around 4 s, channelled southwestwardly from the SGB into LAB), yet the amplitudes with which these distinctive wavefield patterns are excited change, depending upon source details (slip distribution, direction and velocity of rupture). We describe a method for rapid calculation of the sensitivity of such predicted wavefield features to perturbations of the source kinematics, using a time-reversed (adjoint) wavefield simulation. The calculations are analogous to those done in adjoint tomography, and the same time-reversed calculation also yields path-sensitivity kernels that give further insight into the excitation mechanism. For rupture on the southernmost 300 km of SAF, LAB excitation is greatest for slip concentrated between the northern Coachella Valley and the transverse ranges, propagating to the NE and with rupture velocities between 3250 and 3500 m s–1 along that fault segment; that is, within or slightly above the velocity range (between Rayleigh and S velocities) that is energetically precluded in the limit of a sharp rupture front, highlighting the potential value of imposing physical constraints (such as from spontaneous rupture models) on source parametrizations. LAB excitation is weak for rupture to the SW and for ruptures in either direction located north of the transverse transverse ranges, whereas Ventura Basin (VTB) is preferentially excited by NE ruptures situated north of the transverse ranges. Path kernels show that LAB excitation is mediated by surface waves deflected by the velocity contrast along the southern margin of the transverse ranges, having most of their energy in basement rock until they impinge on the eastern edge of SGB, through which they are then funnelled into LAB. VTB amplification is enhanced by a similar waveguide effect.},

  abstract = {Realistic anelastic attenuation can be incorporated rigorously into finite difference and other numerical wave propagation methods using internal or memory variables. The main impediment to the realistic treatment of anelastic attenuation in 3D is the very large computational storage requirement imposed by the additional variables. We previously proposed an alternative to the conventional memory-variable formulation, the method of coarse-grain memory variables, and demonstrated its effectiveness in acoustic problems. We generalize this memory-efficient formulation to 3D anelasticity and describe a fourth-order, staggered-grid finite-difference implementation. The anelastic coarse-grain method applied to plane wave propagation successfully simulates frequency-independent Qp and Qs. Apparent Q values are constant to within 4\% tolerance over approximately two decades in frequency and biased less than 4\% from specified target values. This performance is comparable to that achieved previously for acoustic-wave propagation, and accuracy could be further improved by optimizing the memory-variable relaxation times and weights. For a given assignment of relaxation times and weights, the coarse-grain method provides an eight-fold reduction in the storage requirement for memory variables, relative to the conventional approach. The method closely approximates the wavenumber-integration solution for the response of an anelastic half-space to a shallow dislocation source, accurately calculating all phases including the surface-diffracted SP phase and the Rayleigh wave. The half-space test demonstrates that the wave field-averaging concept underlying the coarse-grain method is effective near boundaries and in the presence of evanescent waves. We anticipate that this method will also be applicable to unstructured grid methods, such as the finite-element method and the spectral-element method, although additional numerical testing will be required to establish accuracy in the presence of grid irregularity. The method is not effective at wavelengths equal to and shorter than 4 grid cell dimensions, where it produces anomalous scattering effects. This limitation could be significant for very high-order numerical schemes under some circumstances (i.e., whenever wave-lengths as short as 4 grids are otherwise within the usable bandwidth of the scheme), but it is of no practical importance in our fourth-order finite-difference implementation.},

The model is based on the analysis of 3-D numerical simulations (finite element and finite difference) of long-period (2–10 s) ground motions for a suite of sixty scenario earthquakes (Mw 6.3 to Mw 7.1) within the Los Angeles basin region. We find depth to the 1.5 km/s S-wave velocity isosurface to be a suitable predictor variable, and also present alternative versions of the model based on depths to the 1.0 and 2.5 km/s isosurfaces. The resulting mean basin-depth effect is period dependent, and both smoother (as a function of period and depth) and higher in amplitude than predictions from local 1-D models. The main requirement for the use of the results in construction of attenuation relationships is determining the extent to which the basin effect, as defined and quantified in this study, is already accounted for implicitly in existing attenuation relationships, through (1) departures of the average “rock” site from our idealized reference model, and (2) correlation of basin depth with other predictor variables (such as V               s30               ).},

  abstract = {We examine the extent to which the response of a perfectly elastic half-space to an SH-wave incident from below can be characterized when knowledge about the elastic structure is limited to the near surface. Elastic properties are modeled as piecewise continuous functions of the depth coordinate. It is found that the site amplification function can be determined with a frequency resolution that depends inversely on the depth to which the elastic structure is known. Specifically, certain spectral averages of the site amplification function, concentrated over bandwidth Δƒ, depend only on the elastic structure down to a two-way travel-time depth of 1/Δƒ. These spectral averages are entirely independent of the elastic properties at greater depth. Equivalently, when the incident motion has a bandlimited white power spectrum of bandwidth Δƒ, the site amplification of the root mean square (rms) ground motion depends only on the elastic structure down to a two-way travel-time depth of 1/Δƒ. When the bandwidth is sufficiently large, the following corollary applies: the rms surface ground motion equals the rms incident motion multiplied by 2√Ib/I0, where I0 and Ib are shear impedances at the ground surface and basement depth, respectively. This result provides justification for a procedure conventionally used to correct stochastic estimates of earthquake ground motion to account for local site effects. The analysis also clarifies the limitations of that conventional procedure.The results define specific site-response parameters that can be computed from knowledge of shallow structure alone and may thereby contribute to improved understanding of the physical basis for, and limitations of, site classification schemes that are based on average S-wave velocity at shallow depth. While the analytical results are rigorous only for infinite Q, numerical experiments indicate that similar results apply to models with finite, frequency-independent Q. The practical utility of the results is likely to be limited primarily by the degree of lateral heterogeneity present near sites of interest and the degree to which the sites respond nonlinearly to incident ground motion.},

  abstract = {In situ measurements of petrophysical properties of the upper crust from wire-line logs provide a direct means of assessing fluctuations in these properties with depth, and thus allow for the statistical characterization of crustal heterogeneity. Wire-line logs from a cluster of nine boreholes (1000–1500 m deep) have been analysed using four different techniques: autocorrelation, semi-variogram, rescaled range and power spectra. Six of the boreholes are vertical, the remainder inclined. All penetrate clastic and pyroclastic rock. The analysis techniques have been tested on synthetic data, for which we have precise control on the scaling, in order to assess their robustness. The results, for the borehole data, show broad-band fractal scaling with a fractal dimension of 1.62 to 1.97 (autocorrelation), 1.59 to 1.79 (rescaled range) and 1.61 to 2.0 (power spectra). The use of different techniques to estimate the fractal dimension provides an excellent constraint on the results. Furthermore, it allows us to determine which model for crustal heterogeneity best describes the data: a ‘band-limited’ von Kármán function or ‘unbounded’ fractal scaling. In order to test the possible anisotropy in the scaling parameters, the horizontal scaling properties for this area have been calculated by correlation-spectra analysis of neighbouring wells. This suggests that upper-crustal correlation lengths are of the order of kilometres and anisotropic, being over four times greater in the horizontal direction. The origins of the observed power-law scaling are complex. Analysis of long-term correlations between logs and televiewer data points towards the influence of fracture porosity within the pyroclastics. But a fractal distribution of pore spaces within the clastics also controls the log fluctuations. Separating the logs into clastic and pyroclastic subsets reveals slight differences in fractal scaling, as determined by autocorrelation and semi-variogram. These differences are attributed to the dominance of either primary or fracture porosity within each geological unit.},

Using records from three super-deep boreholes (KTB and Cajon Pass) and synthetic data, we assess three different techniques for estimating fractal dimension and correlation length. Inaccurate correlation lengths may result from the way in which the autocorrelation is calculated for well-logs, leading to an incorrect application of the von Kármán function.

  abstract = {Physical limits on ground-motion parameters can be estimated from spontaneous-rupture earthquake models but are subject to uncertainties in model parameters. We investigate physical limits at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, and assess sensitivities due to uncertainties in fault geometry, off-fault rock strength, the seismogenic depth, fault zone structure, and undrained poroelastic response of the fluid pressure. For the extreme scenario of nearly complete stress drop on the Solitario Canyon fault, peak ground velocity (PGV) at a site near the fault is sensitive to deep fault geometry and cohesive strength of shallow geologic units, while it is relatively insensitive to fault zone structure, the seismogenic depth, and pore-pressure response. Taking previous estimates of Andrews et~al. (2007) as a benchmark, a 10° reduction in dip (from 60° to 50°) of the Solitario Canyon fault at depth, combined with doubled cohesion of shallow units, can increase both horizontal and vertical PGVs by over 1 m/s, to values exceeding 5 m/s. In a lower stress-drop scenario (constrained by regional extremes of coseismic slip inferred from the paleoseismic record), PGV is most sensitive to fault geometry at depth, is only modestly affected by fault zone structure, and is insensitive to cohesion of shallow units and pore-pressure response. Effects of rock strength on spectral acceleration are significant only at short periods (i.e., less than 3~s). The dipping normal-fault models predict asymmetric inelastic strain distributions with respect to the fault plane, with more intense inelastic deformation on the hanging wall, though that asymmetry may be moderated by poroelastic effects.},

Both the classic staggered grid finite difference scheme and the partially staggered grid scheme are tested. The accuracy of the hybrid method is studied by comparison with a semi-analytical and another numerical method. Subsequently, to study the amplification, numerical simulations of seismic wave propagation in a series of hills are carried out and compared with the single-hill case. Depending on the position of the source in relation to the topography, the ratio between the heights and lengths of the hills or the ratio between the lengths of the hills and the wavelength, the presence of several hills as opposed to a single one can increase the amplification effect due to topography. This study highlights the fact that, when evaluating topographic site effects, surrounding topography must be taken into account in addition to local topography.},

Plastic deformation bounds stresses near the rupture front and limits slip velocities to ∼10 m/s, a bound expected to be independent of earthquake magnitude. As originally shown for ruptures in an elastic medium (Zheng and Rice, 1998), a consequence of strongly rate-weakening friction is the existence of a critical background stress level at which self-sustaining rupture propagation, in the form of self-healing slip pulses, is just barely possible. At higher background stress levels, ruptures are cracklike. This phenomenology remains unchanged when allowing for off-fault plasticity, but the critical stress level is increased. The increase depends on the extent and magnitude of plastic deformation, which is influenced by the orientation of the initial stress field and the proximity of the initial stress state to the yield surface.},

We study dynamic rupture propagation on self-similar faults having root mean square (rms) height fluctuations of order 10-3 to 10-2 times the profile length. Our 2D plane strain models feature strongly rate-weakening fault friction and off-fault Drucker–Prager viscoplasticity. The latter bounds otherwise unreasonably large stress concentrations in the vicinity of bends. Our choice of a cohesionless yield function prevents tensile stress states and thus fault opening. A consequence of strongly rate-weakening friction is the existence of a critical background stress level above which self-sustaining rupture propagation, in the form of self-healing slip pulses, first becomes possible. Around this level, at which natural faults are expected to operate, ruptures become extremely sensitive to fault roughness and exhibit substantial fluctuations in rupture velocity. Except for shallow inclinations of the maximum compressive stress to the fault (less than about 20°), the fluctuations are anticorrelated with the local fault slope. These accelerations and decelerations of the rupture, together with naturally emerging slip heterogeneity, excite waves of all wavelengths and result in ground acceleration spectra that are flat at high frequency, consistent with observed strong motion records.},

Calculations are second-order in space and time. A correction term is employed for suppression of spurious zero-energy modes (hourglass oscillations). We develop a free surface boundary condition, and an absorbing boundary condition using the method of perfectly matched layers (PML). Numerical tests using a layered material model in a highly deformed mesh show good agreement with the frequency-wavenumber method, for resolutions greater than 10 nodes per wavelength. We also test a vertically incident P wave on a semi-circular canyon, for which results match boundary integral solutions at resolutions greater that 20 nodes per wavelength.

When accounting for temporal fluctuations in the background seismicity, only 18\% of the analyzed foreshock sequences remain unexplained by the background seismicity. These results imply that even in a highly complete earthquake catalog, the majority of earthquakes do not exhibit detectable foreshock sequences.},

Lg attenuation is determined from time-domain amplitude measurements in one-octave frequency bands centered on the frequencies 0.75, 1.0, 3.0, 6.0, and 12.0 Hz. Modeling errors are determined using a delete-j jackknife resampling technique. The frequency-dependent quality factor is modeled in the form of Q = Q0fη. Regions were initially selected based on tectonic provinces but were eventually limited and adjusted to maximize ray path coverage in each area. Earthquake data was recorded on several different networks and constrained to events occurring within the crust (\&lt;40 km depth) and at least mb 3.5 in size. A singular value decomposition inversion technique was applied to the data to simultaneously solve for source and receiver terms along with Q for each region at specific frequencies. The lowest crustal Q was observed in northern and southern California where Q is described by the functions Q = 152(±37)f0.72(±0.16) and Q = 105(±26)f0.67(±0.16), respectively. The Basin and Range Province, Pacific Northwest, and Rocky Mountain states also display lower Q and a strong frequency dependence characterized by the functions Q = 200(±40)f0.68(±0.12), Q = 152(±49)f0.76(±0.18), and Q = 166(±37)f0.61(±0.14), respectively.

These results improve upon previous Lg modeling by subdividing the United States into smaller, distinct tectonic regions and using significantly more data that provide improved constraints on frequency-dependent attenuation and errors. A detailed attenuation map of the continental United States can provide significant input into hazard map mitigation. Both scattering and intrinsic attenuation mechanisms are likely to play a comparable role in the frequency range considered in the study.},

First, sediment to bedrock spectral-ratio estimates between pairs of sites are compared with those obtained from various generalizedinversion approaches where the source and site effects of multiply recorded events are solved for simultaneously. We find that the site amplification factors are very similar among these approaches, but that the uncertainties can be significantly different depending on how the data are weighted.},

  abstract = {We analyze the pattern of phase and amplitude variations of seismic waves across the NORSAR array on a statistical basis in order to determine the statistical distribution of heterogeneities under NORSAR. Important observables that have been analyzed in the past are the phase (or travel time) and log amplitude variances and the transverse coherence functions (TCFs) of phase and amplitude fluctuations. We propose and develop the theory and methods of using other observables to reduce the degree of nouniqueness and increase the spatial resolution of the analysis. Most important are the angular coherence functions (ACFs), which characterize quantitatively the change in the pattern of fluctuations across the array from one incoming angle (or beam) to another and which have a different sensitivity to the depth distribution of heterogeneities than the TCFs. A combination of the ACFs and TCFs allows estimation of the power spectra of the P wave speed variations under the array as a function of depth. We use data for phase fluctuations from 104 incident beams and amplitude fluctuations from 185 beams with 2-Hz center frequency at NORSAR to calculate the three ACFs and three TCFs (of phase, log amplitude, and their cross coherence). The measured rms travel time fluctuation is 0.135 s, and the rms log amplitude fluctuation is 0.41. The half-coherence widths of the ACFs are 3° for log amplitude and 9° for phase. The half-coherence widths of the TCFs are 18 km for phase and less than the minimum separation between the elements of the array for log amplitude. In order to account for these features of the data, we adopt a two-overlapping-layer model for lithospheric and asthenospheric heterogeneities underneath NORSAR, with spectra that are band-limited between the wavelengths of 5.5 and 110 km. Our best model has an upper layer with a flat power spectrum extending from the surface to about 200 km, and a lower layer with a K−4 power spectrum extending from 15 to 250 km. The latter spectrum corresponds to an exponential correlation function with scale larger than the observation aperture (110 km). The rms P wave speed variations the in the range 1–4\%. The small scale heterogeneities may be attributed to clustered cracks or intrusions; the larger-scale wavespeed heterogeneities are temperature or compositional heterogeneities that may be related to chemical differentiation, or dynamical processes in the boundary layer of mantle convection.},

  abstract = {We compare the attenuation of high-frequency (3–30 Hz) shear waves for crustal paths in New York State, South Africa, and southern California over source-receiver distances of about 10–400 km. The data consist of digital recordings of S waves (Δ = 5–100 km) and Lg waves (Δ = 100–400 km) produced by earthquakes. We use a coda normalization method to remove the effects of site amplification and source excitation from the amplitudes of the S and Lg waves. Over the entire distance range studied (10–400 km), the amplitude decay of 3-Hz shear wave energy is considerably less for the tectonicaily stable areas of New York and South Africa than for the tectonicaily active region of southern California. High-frequency (30 Hz) S wave attenuation is significantly less for New York and South Africa than for southern California, for distances between 15 and 90 km. We parameterize the decay with distance (R) of coda-normalized shear wave amplitudes with a frequency-independent Q and geometrical spreading exponent γ, where geometrical spreading is proportional to R−γ. For New York State the S wave amplitude decay (3–30 Hz) is well described by a frequency-independent Q of 2100−330+490 and γ of 1.3±0.1. The decay of Lg wave amplitudes from 3 to 15 Hz in the New York State region is fit with a frequency-independent Q of 1600−280+330 γ of 0.70±0.2. The S wave amplitudes (3–30Hz) in South Africa yield a Q of 1500−190+380 and γ of 1.3±0.1. Fixing the geometrical spreading at R−0.5 produces an Lg wave Q estimate at 3 Hz in South Africa of 360−50+80. This Lg wave Q is low considering that South Africa is a cratonic, tectonicaily stable area. The S wave amplitudes from southern California are described with a frequency-independent Q of 800−150+240 and a large geometrical spreading exponent of γ of 1.9±0.2. We find an Lg wave Q at 3 Hz of 260±30 for southern California, after constraining the geometrical spreading at R−0.5.},

  abstract = {The finite-difference method is used to propagate elastic waves through a 3-D model of the Santa Clara Valley, an alluvium-filled basin that underlies the city of San Jose, California. The model was based on depth to bedrock information from water wells in the area. The simulation corresponded to a region 30 (east-west) by 22 (north-south) by 6 (depth) km and contained about 4 million grid points. Synthetic seismograms from the simulation are accurate at frequencies up to 1 Hz. Motions from a magnitude 4.4 aftershock of the Loma Prieta earthquake were modeled. Snapshots of ground motion and synthetic seismograms from the simulation are presented. The simulation illustrates S-to-surface-wave conversion at the edges of the basin and the large amplitude and long duration of ground motion in the basin compared to the surrounding rock. Love waves produced at the edge of the basin are the largest arrivals in the transverse synthetics. Because of the slow group velocity of the Love waves, sites near the center of the basin have longer durations of significant motions than basin sites near the valley edges. Sites near the center of the basin also show larger peak amplitudes on the transverse component. Array analysis of the synthetic seismograms indicates that Love waves tend to propagate parallel to the eastern and western edges of the valley. Rayleigh waves are produced along the southern margin of the basin from incident S waves. Large radial motions occur where a Rayleigh wave impinges on the northeast margin of the valley. Some Rayleigh waves travel westward across the basin, after being scattered from the eastern edge of the valley. Synthetic seismograms from the simulation have similar peak amplitudes as seismograms recorded by the Sunnyvale dense array for this aftershock, although the duration of the tranverse component is not matched by the synthetic seismogram, using this basin model. The simulation indicates that the Love waves observed on the actual seismograms were produced by conversion of incident S waves at the southern margin of the Santa Clara Valley. 2-D simulations show how the S-to-Love-wave conversion is affected by the angle of incidence of the S wave and the sharpness of the velocity transition between the alluvium and bedrock. As more accurate basin models are developed, 3-D simulations should become valuable for predicting ground motions in sedimentary basins for future large earthquakes.},

  abstract = {In this study, numerical investigation is performed on a realistic source-to-site earthquake scenario, with the aim to assess the role of complex 3-D geological structures on the predicted wavefield. With this respect, the paper pointedly targets the seismic response of nuclear power plants in near-field conditions and the verification of some simplified assumptions commonly adopted for earthquake ground motion prediction and site effects analysis. To this purpose, the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant (Japan) is assumed as reference case-study. In 2007, the nuclear site and its surroundings were struck by the Niigata-Ken Chu¯etsu-Oki seismic sequence, which caused some of the peak ground motion design limits to be largely overpassed. The dense observation network deployed at the site recorded a highly incoherent and impulsive earthquake ground motion. Many studies argued that the intricate synclineanticline geology lying underneath the nuclear facility was highly responsible of the observed seismic response. Therefore, a physics-based numerical model of the epicentral area is builtup (≈60 km wide) and tested for small aftershocks, so to discount the effect of extended source on the synthetic site-response. The numerical model (based on the Spectral Element Method) reproduces the source-to-site wave propagation by embracing the effects of the surface topography along with the presence of the Japan Sea (i.e. the bathymetry, the coastline and the fluid–solid interaction). Broad-band (0–5 Hz) synthetic waveforms are obtained for two different aftershocks, located at the two opposite sides of the nuclear facility, aiming to assess the influence of the incidence angle the radiated wave field impinges the foldings beneath it. The effect of the folding presence is assessed by comparing it to a subhorizontally layered geology, in terms of numerical outcome, and by highlighting the differences with respect to the observations. The presence of an intricate geology effectively unveils the reason behind the observed ground motion spatial variability within a relatively small area, stressing its crucial role to properly reproduce the modification the wavefield undergoes during its propagation path towards the surface. The accuracy of the numerical exercise is discussed along with its results, to show the high-fidelity of these deterministic earthquake ground motion predictions.},

Amplification at mountain tops for wavelengths comparable with mountain widths is predicted and observed, but the numerical simulations often underestimate the actual observed effects. We propose that this disagreement is because current models are not complex enough.We therefore computed the response to incident SH waves of a set of different complex configurations that include two-dimensional surface topography, with or without periodic ridges and subsurface layering. The results show that: (1) the topographic effect in itself is difficult to isolate from other effects, like surface layering, and therefore the amplification on top of geomorphologically complex sites cannot be predicted by a priori estimations based solely on topography; and (2) the high crest/base amplification ratio observed in the field cannot, usually, be matched even with complex two-dimensional structures with incident plane SH waves, which suggests that more complex models are needed to incorporate more complex wave fields (e.g., SV, surface) and three-dimensional geologic configurations.},

Our main theorem is that one can introduce a treatment of the boundaries for which the stability of the system follows immediately from the stability for a scalar equation. This is accomplished by operating on the characteristic variables for those quantities that are not specified on the boundary. In a working code this can be accomplished by adding a correction term to the existing boundary algorithm.

Due to the staggered grid, the closest distance between the free surface and some wave-field components for both implementations is 1/2-grid spacing. Overall, the differences in accuracy of the two implementations are small. When compared to a reflectivity solution computed at the staggered positions closest to the surface, the total misfit for all three components of the wave field is generally found to be larger for the free surface colocated with the normal stresses, compared to that for the free surface colocated with the xz and yz stresses. However, this trend is reversed when compared to the reflectivity solution exactly at the free surface (the misfit encountered in staggered-grid modeling). When the wave field is averaged across the free surface, thereby centering the staggered wave field exactly on the free surface, the free-surface condition colocated with the xz and yz stresses generates the smallest total misfit for increasing epicentral distance. For an epicentral distance/hypocentral depth of 10, the total misfit of this condition is about 15\% smaller than that for the condition colocated with the normal stresses, mainly controlled by the misfit on the Rayleigh wave.},

In our approach, fault rupture is represented kinematically and incorporates spatial heterogeneity in slip, rupture speed, and rise time. The prescribed slip distribution is constrained to follow an inverse wavenumber-squared fall-off and the average rupture speed is set at 80\% of the local shear-wave velocity, which is then adjusted such that the rupture propagates faster in regions of high slip and slower in regions of low slip. We use a Kostrov-like slip-rate function having a rise time proportional to the square root of slip, with the average rise time across the entire fault constrained empirically. Recent observations from large surface rupturing earthquakes indicate a reduction of rupture propagation speed and lengthening of rise time in the near surface, which we model by applying a 70\% reduction of the rupture speed and increasing the rise time by a factor of 2 in a zone extending from the surface to a depth of 5 km. We demonstrate the fidelity of the technique by modeling the strong-motion recordings from the Imperial Valley, Loma Prieta, Landers, and Northridge earthquakes.},

  abstract = {We present a methodology for generating broadband (0 - 10 Hz) ground motion time histories for moderate and larger crustal earthquakes. Our hybrid technique combines a stochastic approach at high frequencies with a deterministic approach at low frequencies. The broadband response is obtained by summing the separate responses in the time domain using matched filters centered at 1 Hz. We use a kinematic description of fault rupture, incorporating spatial heterogeneity in slip, rupture velocity and rise time by discretizing an extended finite-fault into a number of smaller subfaults. The stochastic approach sums the response for each subfault assuming a random phase, an omega-squared source spectrum and generic ray-path Green's functions. Gross impedance effects are incorporated using quarter wavelength theory to bring the response to a reference baserock velocity level. The deterministic approach sums the response for many point sources distributed across each subfault. Wave propagation at frequencies below 1 Hz is modeled using a 3D viscoelastic finite difference algorithm with the minimum shear wave velocity set between 600 and 1000 m/s, depending on the scope and complexity of the velocity structure. To account for site-specific geologic conditions, short- and mid-period empirical amplification factors provided by Borcherdt [1] are used to develop frequency-dependent non-linear site response functions. The amplification functions are applied to the stochastic and deterministic responses separately since these may have different (computational) reference site velocities. We note that although the amplification factors are strictly defined for response spectra, we have applied them to the Fourier amplitude spectra of our simulated time histories. This process appears to be justified because the amplification functions vary slowly with frequency and the method produces favorable comparisons with observations. We demonstrate the applicability of the technique by modeling the broadband strong ground motion recordings from the 1989 Loma Prieta and 1994 Northridge earthquakes.},

  abstract = {CyberShake, as part of the Southern California Earthquake Center’s (SCEC) Community Modeling Environment, is developing a methodology that explicitly incorporates deterministic source and wave propagation effects within seismic hazard calculations through the use of physics-based 3D ground motion simulations. To calculate a waveform-based seismic hazard estimate for a site of interest, we begin with Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast, Version 2.0 (UCERF2.0) and identify all ruptures within 200 km of the site of interest. We convert the UCERF2.0 rupture definition into multiple rupture variations with differing hypocenter locations and slip distributions, resulting in about 415,000 rupture variations per site. Strain Green Tensors are calculated for the site of interest using the SCEC Community Velocity Model, Version 4 (CVM4), and then, using reciprocity, we calculate synthetic seismograms for each rupture variation. Peak intensity measures are then extracted from these synthetics and combined with the original rupture probabilities to produce probabilistic seismic hazard curves for the site. Being explicitly site-based, CyberShake directly samples the ground motion variability at that site over many earthquake cycles (i.e., rupture scenarios) and alleviates the need for the ergodic assumption that is implicitly included in traditional empirically based calculations. Thus far, we have simulated ruptures at over 200 sites in the Los Angeles region for ground shaking periods of 2 s and longer, providing the basis for the first generation CyberShake hazard maps. Our results indicate that the combination of rupture directivity and basin response effects can lead to an increase in the hazard level for some sites, relative to that given by a conventional Ground Motion Prediction Equation (GMPE). Additionally, and perhaps more importantly, we find that the physics-based hazard results are much more sensitive to the assumed magnitude-area relations and magnitude uncertainty estimates used in the definition of the ruptures than is found in the traditional GMPE approach. This reinforces the need for continued development of a better understanding of earthquake source characterization and the constitutive relations that govern the earthquake rupture process.},

  abstract = {We describe a methodology for generating kinematic earthquake ruptures for use in 3D ground-motion simulations over the 0–5 Hz frequency band. Our approach begins by specifying a spatially random slip distribution that has a roughly wavenumber-squared fall-off. Given a hypocenter, the rupture speed is specified to average about 75\%–80\% of the local shear wavespeed and the prescribed slip-rate function has a Kostrov-like shape with a fault-averaged rise time that scales selfsimilarly with the seismic moment. Both the rupture time and rise time include significant local perturbations across the fault surface specified by spatially random fields that are partially correlated with the underlying slip distribution. We represent velocity-strengthening fault zones in the shallow ({$<$} 5 km) and deep ({$>$} 15 km) crust by decreasing rupture speed and increasing rise time in these regions. Additional refinements to this approach include the incorporation of geometric perturbations to the fault surface, 3D stochastic correlated perturbations to the P- and S-wave velocity structure, and a damage zone surrounding the shallow fault surface characterized by a 30\% reduction in seismic velocity. We demonstrate the approach using a suite of simulations for a hypothetical Mw 6.45 strike-slip earthquake embedded in a generalized hard-rock velocity structure. The simulation results are compared with the median predictions from the 2014 Next Generation Attenuation-West2 Project ground-motion prediction equations and show very good agreement over the frequency band 0.1–5 Hz for distances out to 25 km from the fault. Additionally, the newly added features act to reduce the coherency of the radiated higher frequency (f {$>$} 1 Hz) ground motions, and homogenize radiation-pattern effects in this same bandwidth, which move the simulations closer to the statistical characteristics of observed motions as illustrated by comparison with recordings from the 1979 Imperial Valley earthquake.},

In addition to presenting generalized, discrete representations of the differential equations of motion using the staggered-grid approach, we also provide detailed formulations that describe the incorporation of moment-tensor sources, the implementation of a stable and accurate representation of a planar free-surface boundary for 3D models, and the derivation and implementation of an approximate technique to model spatially variable anelastic attenuation within time-domain finite-difference computations. The comparison of results obtained using the staggered-grid technique with those obtained using a frequency-wavenumber algorithm shows excellent agreement between the two methods for a variety of models. In addition, this article also introduces a memory optimization procedure that allows large-scale 3D finite-difference problems to be computed on a conventional, single-processor desktop workstation. With this technique, model storage is accommodated using both external (hard-disk) and internal (core) memory. To reduce system overhead, a cascaded time update procedure is utilized to maximize the number of computations performed between I/O operations. This formulation greatly expands the applicability of the 3D finite-difference technique by providing an efficient and practical algorithm for implementation on commonly available workstation platforms.},

  abstract = {Uncertainty in site response analyses can be attributed to a number of parameters, including analysis methods, input ground motions, nonlinear dynamic soil properties, and shear-wave velocity profiles. In this paper, several approaches commonly used to account for shear-wave velocity (Vs) uncertainty in site response are investigated. Specifically, the Vs profiles considered are categorized into three groups: (1) Vs profiles determined directly from surface-wave inversion, (2) simple statistical Vs profiles derived indirectly from the surface-wave Vs profiles (including bounding-type, median, and other percentile Vs profiles), and (3) statistically based, randomly generated Vs profiles. A companion paper discusses the development of these Vs profiles for two international blind-study sites. In this paper, the effects of using each approach to account for Vs uncertainty in site response are investigated by linking the dispersion misfit values for each Vs profile to variability in equivalent linear site response estimates. Clear trends exist between variability in site response estimates and dispersion misfit values at both sites. Thus, the experimental dispersion data can be used to help select suites of Vs profiles, generated either directly from inversion or through a randomization model, that account for uncertainty in a meaningful way without including unrealistic statistical profiles that result in too much site response variability.

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of the intensity and variability of strong ground motions from future large earthquakes depends on our ability to simulate realistic earthquake source models. We have developed a procedure to generate physically consistent earthquake-rupture models that should help make such simulations more accurate. We term these models “pseudo dynamic” because they are kinematic models that are designed to emulate important characteristics of dynamic rupture. We construct pseudo-dynamic models first by generating a slip distribution as a realization of a spatial random field that is consistent in its scaling and spatial variability with slip distributions observed in past earthquakes. We then compute the static stress drop associated with the slip distribution, which in turn is used to estimate the temporal evolution of slip through a set of empirical relationships derived from the analysis of spontaneous rupture models. Finally, a simple energy-budget calculation is used to eliminate models that are not likely to propagate spontaneously. The principal advantage of the pseudo-dynamic approach is that it avoids the computational demands of generating fully dynamic rupture models for multiple realizations of a scenario earthquake. While the relationships between source parameters described in this paper are simplifications of the true complexity of the physics of rupture, they help identify important interactions between source properties that are relevant for strong ground motion prediction, and should provide an improvement over purely kinematic models.},

The proposed V/H ratio GMPE is dependent on the earthquake magnitude and distance, consistent with previous models, but it differs from previous studies in that it accounts for the differences in the nonlinear site-response effects on the horizontal and vertical components. This difference in nonlinear effects results in large V/H ratios at short spectral periods for soil sites located close to large earthquakes. A method to develop vertical design spectra dependent on the horizontal component uniform hazard spectrum that accounts for the correlation between the variability of the horizontal ground-motion model and the variability of the V/H ratio ground-motion model is proposed.},

  abstract = {Envelopes of scalar waves are simulated at various distances from an instant point source embedded in a random uniformly scattering medium by means of direct Monte-Carlo modelling of wave-energy transport. Three types of scattering radiation pattern ('indicatrix') are studied, for media specified by (1) a Gaussian autocorrelation function of inhomogeneities, (2) a power-law ('fractal', k−α) inhomogeneity spectrum and (3) the mix of case (1) and the isotropic indicatrix (very small + large inhomogeneities). We look for a model that can qualitatively reproduce the two most characteristic features of real S-wave envelopes of near earthquakes, namely (1) the broadening of the ‘direct’ wave group with distance and (2) the monotonously decaying shape of the coda envelope that does not deviate strongly from that expected in the isotropic scattering case. Both properties are observed for any band over a wide frequency range (1–40 Hz). The well-studied isotropic scattering model realistically predicts the appearance of codas but fails to predict pulse broadening. The model of large-scale inhomogeneity realistically predicts the mode of pulse broadening but fails to predict codas. We have found that, for a particular frequency band, within each class of inhomogeneity studied, both requirements can be qualitatively satisfied by a certain choice of parameters. In the Gaussian-ACF case, however, this match can be obtained only for a narrow frequency range. In contrast, the fractal case (with a value of exponent a of about 3.5–4) reproduces qualitatively the observed wide-band behaviour, and we consider it a reasonable representation of the gross properties of the earth medium.},

  abstract = {Earthquake damage at a given location depends on properties of the arriving elastic waves, of the ground at the shaken site, and of the structures involved. To investigate effects of the ground on the motion at the surface, five identical seismographs have been operated temporarily at 25 locations within 30 miles from the Seismological Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, and their records have been compared with those written by an identical instrument recording in routine at the Seismological Laboratory. The ratio of amplitudes at sites on fairly dry alluvium more than 500 feet deep to those at the Seismological Laboratory (on crystalline rock) is frequently 5 : 1 or more for earthquake waves having periods of 1 to 1 1/2 sec. For waves having periods of 0.1 ± sec. and waves having periods exceeding 10 sec. (length more than 10 miles) the corresponding differences in amplitudes are small. Amplitudes of earthquake waves and of the continuous unrest of the ground recorded at sites on water-saturated soft ground may be ten times those recorded at the Laboratory. The period of waves for which the response relative to that at the Seismological Laboratory is greatest usually decreases as the thickness of the alluvium decreases and is about ¼ sec. at stations on alluvium 100 ± feet thick. At stations on crystalline rock the motion of the ground does not differ significantly from that at the Laboratory for waves having periods exceeding ¼ sec.At sites on alluvium, relatively strong shaking lasts several times as long as at those on crystalline rock; usually this ratio decreases with decreasing thickness of the alluvium. Ground effects may produce appreciable differences in duration and amount of shaking even at localities only a fraction of a mile apart. The importance of selecting crystalline rock or at least dry ground and avoiding water-saturated soft ground for foundations of buildings to reduce potential earthquake damage is stressed.},

For close recording distances of ≃10 km, fmax for California earthquakes is generally found within the very narrow band 10 ≲ fmax ≲ 20 Hz, without regard to source strength or tectonic setting. Direct evidence for fmax (in the form of shear-wave acceleration spectral amplitudes) and indirect evidence as well (in the form of limiting spectral corner frequencies) have often been taken as manifestations of source properties, barrier end-zones, for example. This study concludes that fmax as actually observed is more likely to be a property of local site conditions, although this does not preclude source-controlled band-limitations at still higher frequencies. Observations of fmax for a single Oroville aftershock show a small but significant site-to-site variation that correlates well with gross surface geology; this variation is “normalized” with a demonstration that fmax for seven of the principal aftershocks (4.0 ≦ ML ≦ 4.9) at a single station has a distinctly smaller variation. Moreover, there seems to be nothing fundamental about the range 10 ≲ fmax ≲ 20 Hz so typical for California earthquakes; spectral shear-wave corner frequencies observed at very close distances (≲5 km) and for especially competent propagation paths are known to occupy the band 20 ≦ fo(S) ≦ 200 Hz.},

This location is desirable because of its proximity to local earthquake sources and the significant topographic relief of the array (439 m). Topographic amplification is evaluated as a function of frequency using a variety of methods, including reference-site-based spectral ratios and single-station horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratios using both shear waves from earthquakes and ambient noise. Field observations are compared with the predicted ground motion from an accurate digital model of the topography and a 3D local velocity model. Amplification factors from the theoretical calculations are consistent with observations. The fundamental resonance of the ridge is prominently observed in the spectra of data and synthetics; however, higher-frequency peaks are also seen primarily for sources in line with the major axis of the ridge, perhaps indicating higher resonant modes. Excitations of lateral ribs off of the main ridge are also seen at frequencies consistent with their dimensions. The favored directions of resonance are shown to be transverse to the major axes of the topographic features.},

Seventy-two well-recorded local earthquakes are used to calculate spectral amplitude ratios relative to a reference site. A well-defined fundamental resonance peak is observed with individual station amplitudes following the theoretically predicted progression of larger amplitudes in the upslope direction. Favored directions of vibration are also seen that are related to the trapping of shear waves within the primary ridge dimensions. Spectral peaks above the fundamental one are also related to topographic effects but follow a more complex pattern. Theoretical predictions using a 3D velocity model and accurate topography reproduce many of the general frequency and time-domain features of the data. Shifts in spectral frequencies and amplitude differences, however, are related to deficiencies of the model and point out the importance of contributing factors, including the shear-wave velocity under the topographic feature, near-surface velocity gradients, and source parameters.},

  abstract = {Mathematical models of soil nonlinearity in common use and recently developed nonlinear codes are compared to investigate the range of their predictions. We consider equivalent linear formulations with and without frequency-dependent moduli and damping ratios and nonlinear formulations for total and effective stress. Average velocity profiles to 150 m depth with midrange National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program site classifications (B, BC, C, D, and E) in the top 30 m are used to compare the response of a wide range of site conditions from rock to soft soil. Nonlinear soil models are compared using the amplification spectrum, calculated as the ratio of surface ground motion to the input motion at the base of the velocity profile. Peak input motions from 0.1g to 0.9g are considered. For site class B, no significant differences exist between the models considered in this article. For site classes BC and C, differences are small at low input motions (0.1g to 0.2g), but become significant at higher input levels. For site classes D and E the overdamping of frequencies above about 4 Hz by the equivalent linear solution with frequencyindependent parameters is apparent for the entire range of input motions considered. The equivalent linear formulation with frequency-dependent moduli and damping ratios under damps relative to the nonlinear models considered for site class C with larger input motions and most input levels for site classes D and E. At larger input motions the underdamping for site classes D and E is not as severe as the overdamping with the frequency-independent formulation, but there are still significant differences in the time domain. A nonlinear formulation is recommended for site classes D and E and for site classes BC and C with input motions greater than a few tenths of the acceleration of gravity. The type of nonlinear formulation to use is driven by considerations of the importance of water content and the availability of laboratory soils data. Our average amplification curves from a nonlinear effective stress formulation compare favorably with observed spectral amplification at class D and E sites in the Seattle area for the 2001 Nisqually earthquake.},

  abstract = {Time-averaged shear wave velocity over the upper 30\,m of the earth’s surface ( V               S30               ) is a key parameter for estimating ground motion amplification as both a predictive and a diagnostic tool for earthquake hazards. The first-order approximation of V               S30               is commonly obtained through a topographic slope–based or terrain proxy due to the widely available nature of digital elevation models. However, better-constrained V               S30               maps have been developed in many regions. Such maps preferentially employ various combinations of V               S30               measurements, higher-resolution elevation models, lithologic, geologic, geomorphic, and other proxies and often utilize refined interpolation schemes. We develop a new hybrid global V               S30               map database that defaults to the global slope-based V               S30               map, but smoothly inserts regional V               S30               maps where available. In addition, we present comparisons of the default slope-based proxy maps against the new hybrid version in terms of V               S30               and amplification ratio maps, and uncertainties in assigned V               S30               values.},

  abstract = {Seismological images of the Earth's mantle reveal three distinct changes in velocity structure, at depths of 410, 660 and 2,700\,km. The first two are best explained by mineral phase transformations, whereas the third—the D″ layer—probably reflects a change in chemical composition and thermal structure. Tomographic images of cold slabs in the lower mantle, the displacements of the 410-km and 660-km discontinuities around subduction zones, and the occurrence of small-scale heterogeneities in the lower mantle all indicate that subducted material penetrates the deep mantle, implying whole-mantle convection. In contrast, geochemical analyses of the basaltic products of mantle melting are frequently used to infer that mantle convection is layered, with the deeper mantle largely isolated from the upper mantle. We show that geochemical, seismological and heat-flow data are all consistent with whole-mantle convection provided that the observed heterogeneities are remnants of recycled oceanic and continental crust that make up about 16 and 0.3\,per cent, respectively, of mantle volume.},

  abstract = {Sonic-log measurements provide detailed 1-D information on the distribution of elastic properties within the upper crystalline crust at scales from about one metre to several kilometres. 10 P-wave sonic logs from six upper-crustal drill sites in Europe and North America have been analysed for their second-order statistics. The penetrated lithological sequences comprise Archean volcanic sequences, Proterozoic mafic layered intrusions, and Precambrian to Phanerozoic gneisses and granites. Despite this variability in geological setting, tectonic history, and petrological composition, there are notable similarities between the various data sets: after removing a large-scale, deterministic component from the observed velocity-depth function, the residual velocity fluctuations of all data sets can be described by autocovariance functions corresponding to band-limited self-affine stochastic processes with quasi-Gaussian probability density functions. Depending on the maximum spatial wavelength present in the stochastic part of the data, the deterministic trend can be approximated either by a low-order polynomial best fit or by a moving-average of the original sonic-log data. The choice of the trend has a significant impact on the correlation length and on the standard deviation of the residual stochastic component, but does not affect the Hurst number. For trends defined by low-order polynomial best fits, correlation lengths were found to range from 60 to 160 m, whereas for trends defined by a moving average the correlation lengths are dominated by the upper cut-off wavenumber of the corresponding filter. Regardless of the trend removed, the autocovariance functions of all data sets are characterised by low Hurst numbers of around 0.1–0.2, or equivalently by power spectra decaying as ∽ 1/k. A possible explanation of this statistical uniformity is that sonic-log fluctuations are more sensitive to the physical state, in particular to the distribution of cracks, than to the petrological composition of the probed rocks.},

  abstract = {To explore lightning-generated electromagnetic wave behavior and lightning-related ionospheric phenomena, a fullwave two-dimensional cylindrical finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) model was developed to simulate lightning-generated electromagnetic wave propagation in the ionosphere with high altitude and long distance capabilities. This FDTD model removes the approximations made in other similar models to extend its applicability, and incorporates a variety of existing methods and new techniques. A dispersive and anisotropic realization of the nearly perfectly matched layer (NPML) absorbing boundary condition is adopted in this numerical model for ease of implementation. Earth curvature is included in the model through the modified refractive index method. The surface impedance boundary condition is adopted to treat arbitrary but homogeneous ground parameters. We quantify the errors through dispersion relations, and the solution convergence is analyzed. Comparisons between our simulation, numerical waveguide mode theory, and experimental data validate this model and show its capabilities compared to other methods. Although this FDTD model was developed for the lightning-generated electromagnetic field simulation, it is also applicable for other very low frequency (VLF, 3–30 kHz) and extremely low frequency (ELF, 3–3000 Hz) wave propagation problems.},

  abstract = {Empirical transfer functions (ETFs) between seismic records observed at the surface and depth represent a powerful tool to estimate site effects for earthquake hazard analysis. However, conventional modeling of site amplification, with assumptions of horizontally polarized shear waves propagating vertically through 1D layered homogeneous media, often poorly predicts the ETFs, particularly, in which large lateral variations of velocity are present. Here, we test whether more accurate site effects can be obtained from theoretical transfer functions (TTFs) extracted from physics‐based simulations that naturally incorporate the complex material properties. We select two well‐documented downhole sites (the KiK‐net site TKCH05 in Japan and the Garner Valley site, Garner Valley Downhole Array, in southern California) for our study. The 3D subsurface geometry at the two sites is estimated by means of the surface topography near the sites and information from the shear‐wave profiles obtained from borehole logs. By comparing the TTFs to ETFs at the selected sites, we show how simulations using the calibrated 3D models can significantly improve site amplification estimates as compared to 1D model predictions. The primary reason for this improvement in 3D models is redirection of scattering from vertically propagating to more realistic obliquely propagating waves, which alleviates artificial amplification at nodes in the vertical‐incidence response of corresponding 1D approximations, resulting in improvement of site effect estimation. The results demonstrate the importance of reliable calibration of subsurface structure and material properties in site response studies.},

In addition to the hypocentral and epicentral distances used commonly in the past; some other measures of the distance used in the recent attenuation relations are the closest distance to fault rupture, closest distance to the seismogenic portion of the fault rupture, distance to the center of energy release, and the closest distance to the surface projection of the fault rupture plane. The present paper describes the procedure for estimating the various measures of distance and illustrates their dependence on earthquake magnitude, epicentral distance, focal depth, and fault plane orientation. A method is also proposed to define these distances when the orientation of the fault plane is unknown. The study will be useful to have more realistic estimation of the source-to-site distances required as input in both the deterministic and the probabilistic seismic hazard analyses studies.},

  abstract = {An empirical model for estimating the horizontal pseudo-absolute spectral accelerations (PSA) generated by shallow crustal earthquakes was published in 2008 using the recorded earthquake ground motion data collected and documented as part of the original Next Generation Attenuation (NGA) project. A significant number of additional recordings were collected over the past three years, and the 2008 model has been revised using the new data and is presented in this paper. The model was again selected to be simple, and the model parameters were estimated using the expanded database. The revised model incorporates V               S30               as an independent variable because, with the expanded database, it was found that V               S30               was required to be included as an independent parameter to allow for a reasonably unbiased fit to the recorded data. It is noted that V               S30               is not being used to account for nonlinear site response, but strictly to allow for a better fit to the data. These parameters are presented for sites with an average shear wave velocity in the upper 30 m, V               S30               , for sites with V               S30               ≥ 450 m/s. Parameters for sites with V               S30               {$<$} 450 m/s are not included in this paper. For a site with V               S30               = 450 m/s, there is an overall increase in PGA averaging about 50\% over a distance of about 100 km using the 2013 model in comparison to the 2008 model. On the other hand, for a site with V               S30               = 900 m/s, there is an overall decrease of about 10\% using the 2013 model in comparison to the 2008 model.},

  abstract = {The heterogeneous nature of Earth's crust is manifested in the scattering of propagating seismic waves. In recent years, different techniques have been developed to include such phenomenon in broad-band ground-motion calculations, either considering scattering as a semi-stochastic or purely stochastic process. In this study, we simulate broad-band (0–10~Hz) ground motions with a 3-D finite-difference wave propagation solver using several 3-D media characterized by von Karman correlation functions with different correlation lengths and standard deviation values. Our goal is to investigate scattering characteristics and its influence on the seismic wavefield at short and intermediate distances from the source in terms of ground motion parameters. We also examine scattering phenomena, related to the loss of radiation pattern and the directivity breakdown. We first simulate broad-band ground motions for a point-source characterized by a classic ω2 spectrum model. Fault finiteness is then introduced by means of a Haskell-type source model presenting both subshear and super-shear rupture speed. Results indicate that scattering plays an important role in ground motion even at short distances from the source, where source effects are thought to be dominating. In particular, peak ground motion parameters can be affected even at relatively low frequencies, implying that earthquake ground-motion simulations should include scattering also for peak ground velocity (PGV) calculations. At the same time, we find a gradual loss of the source signature in the 2–5~Hz frequency range, together with a distortion of the Mach cones in case of super-shear rupture. For more complex source models and truly heterogeneous Earth, these effects may occur even at lower frequencies. Our simulations suggests that von Karman correlation functions with correlation length between several hundred metres and few kilometres, Hurst exponent around 0.3 and standard deviation in the 5–10~per~cent range reproduce the available observations.},

  abstract = {The scattering of seismic waves travelling in the Earth is not only caused by random velocity heterogeneity but also by surface topography. Both factors are known to strongly affect groundmotion complexity even at relatively short distance from the source. In this study, we simulate ground motion with a 3-D finite-difference wave propagation solver in the 0–5 Hz frequency band using three topography models representative of the Swiss alpine region and realistic heterogeneous media characterized by the Von Karman correlation functions. Subsequently, we analyse and quantify the characteristics of the scattered wavefield in the near-source region. Our study shows that both topography and velocity heterogeneity scattering may excite large coda waves of comparable relative amplitude, especially at around 1 Hz, although large variability in space may occur. Using the single scattering model, we estimate average QC values in the range 20–30 at 1 Hz, 36–54 at 1.5 Hz and 62–109 at 3 Hz for constant background velocity models with no intrinsic attenuation. In principle, envelopes of topography-scattered seismic waves can be qualitatively predicted by theoretical back-scattering models, while forwardor hybrid-scattering models better reproduce the effects of random velocity heterogeneity on the wavefield. This is because continuous multiple scattering caused by small-scale velocity perturbations leads to more gentle coda decay and envelope broadening, while topography abruptly scatters the wavefield once it impinges the free surface. The large impedance contrast also results in more efficient mode mixing. However, the introduction of realistic low-velocity layers near the free surface increases the complexity of ground motion dramatically and indicates that the role of topography in elastic waves scattering can be relevant especially in proximity of the source. Long-period surface waves can form most of the late coda, especially when intrinsic attenuation is taken into account. Our simulations indicate that both topography and velocity heterogeneity scattering may result in large ground-motion variability, characterized by standard deviation values in the range 0.2–0.5 also at short distance from the source. We conclude that both topography and velocity heterogeneity should be considered to correctly assess the ground-motion variability in earthquake scenario studies even at intermediate frequency.},

  abstract = {In this study, a method for simulating the ground motion of megathrust earthquakes at periods of approximately 2 s and longer was validated by using the characterized source model combined with multi-scale spatial heterogeneity. Source models for the MW 8.3, 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake were constructed, and ground motion simulations were conducted to test their performance. First, a characterized source model was generated based on a source model obtained from waveform inversion analysis. Then, multi-scale heterogeneity was added to the spatial distribution of several source parameters to yield a heterogeneous source model. An investigation of the Fourier spectra and 5 \% damped velocity response spectra of the simulated and observed ground motions demonstrated that adding multiscale heterogeneity to the spatial distributions of the slip, rupture velocity, and rake angle of the characterized source model is an effective method for constructing a source model that explains the ground motion at periods of 2–20 s. It was also revealed how the complexity of the parameters affects the resulting ground motion. The complexity of the rupture velocity had the largest influence among the three parameters.},

  abstract = {The effect of alluvium on strong ground motion can be seen by comparing two strong-motion records of the Coyote Lake, California, earthquake of 6 August 1979 (ML = 5.9). One record at a site on Franciscan bedrock had a peak horizontal acceleration of 0.13 g and a peak horizontal velocity of 10 cm/sec. The other, at a site 2 km distant on 180 meters of Quaternary alluvium overlying Franciscan, had values of 0.26 g and 32 cm/sec, amplifications by factors of 2 and 3. Horizontal motions computed at the alluvial site for a linear plane-layered model based on measured P and S velocities show reasonably good agreement in shape with the observed motions, but the observed peak amplitudes are greater by a factor of about 1.25 in acceleration and 1.8 in velocity. About 15 per cent of the discrepancy in acceleration and 20 per cent in velocity can be attributed to the difference in source distance; the remainder may represent focusing by refraction at a bedrock surface concave upward. There is no clear evidence of nonlinear soil response. Fourier spectral ratios between motions observed on bedrock and alluvium show good agreement with ratios predicted from the linear model. In particular, the observed frequency of the fundamental peak in the amplification spectrum agrees with the computed value, indicating that no significant nonlinearity occurs in the secant shear modulus. Computations show that nonlinear models are compatible with the data if values of the coefficient of dynamic shear strength in terms of vertical effective stress are in the range of 0.5 to 1.0 or greater. The data illustrate that site amplification may be less a matter of resonance involving reinforcing multiple reflections, and more the simple effect of the low near-surface velocity. Application of traditional seismological theory leads to the conclusion that the site amplification for peak horizontal velocity is approximately proportional to the reciprocal of the square root of the product of density and shear-wave velocity.},

  abstract = {Vertical seismometer arrays represent a unique interaction between observed and predicted ground motions, and they are especially helpful for validating and comparing site response models. In this study, we perform comprehensive linear, equivalent-linear, and nonlinear site response analyses of 191 ground motions recorded at six validation sites in the Kiban–Kyoshin network (KiK-net) of vertical seismometer arrays in Japan. These sites, which span a range of geologic conditions, are selected because they meet the basic assumptions of one-dimensional (1D) wave propagation, and are therefore ideal for validating and calibrating 1D nonlinear soil models. We employ the equivalent-linear site response program SHAKE, the nonlinear site response program DEEPSOIL, and a nonlinear site response overlay model within the general finite element program Abaqus/Explicit. Using the results from this broad range of ground motions, we quantify the uncertainties of the alternative site response models, measure the strain levels at which the models break down, and provide general recommendations for performing site response analyses. Specifically, we find that at peak shear strains from 0.01\% to 0.1\%, linear site response models fail to accurately predict short-period ground motions; equivalent-linear and nonlinear models offer a significant improvement at strains beyond this level, with nonlinear models exhibiting a slight improvement over equivalent-linear models at strains greater than approximately 0.05\%.},

  abstract = {We present a new numerical approach to solve the elastic wave equation in heterogeneous media in the presence of externally given source terms with arbitrary high-order accuracy in space and time on unstructured triangular meshes. We combine a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with the ideas of the ADER time integration approach using Arbitrary high-order DERivatives. The time integration is performed via the so-called Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure using repeatedly the governing partial differential equation itself. In contrast to classical finite element methods we allow for discontinuities of the piecewise polynomial approximation of the solution at element interfaces. This way, we can use the well-established theory of fluxes across element interfaces based on the solution of Riemann problems as developed in the finite volume framework. In particular, we replace time derivatives in the Taylor expansion of the time integration procedure by space derivatives to obtain a numerical scheme of the same high order in space and time using only one single explicit step to evolve the solution from one time level to another. The method is specially suited for linear hyperbolic systems such as the heterogeneous elastic wave equations and allows an efficient implementation. We consider continuous sources in space and time and point sources characterized by a Delta distribution in space and some continuous source time function. Hereby, the method is able to deal with point sources at any position in the computational domain that does not necessarily need to coincide with a mesh point. Interpolation is automatically performed by evaluation of test functions at the source locations. The convergence analysis demonstrates that very high accuracy is retained even on strongly irregular meshes and by increasing the order of the ADER–DG schemes computational time and storage space can be reduced remarkably. Applications of the proposed method to Lamb's Problem, a problem of strong material heterogeneities and to an example of global seismic wave propagation finally confirm its accuracy, robustness and high flexibility.},

The purpose of this study is to show the possibility that this anomalous damage pattern is due to the amplification by the topographic irregularity when SV waves are near-critical incidence.First we examined the accelerograms obtained at the USGS station (7215 Bright Ave.) nearest to downtown Whittier and conclude that the dominantly eastwest motion observed at the station is due to the influence of the building in which accelerograms were recorded. We next demonstrate that strong ground motions recorded by 12 stations in the epicentral area show a polarization direction pattern that is primarily SV-type, which is consistent with a simple thrust fault located at the hypocenter.Then we calculated the response of a two-dimensional hill with the height 0.3 km and the width 2.4 km to 1) a plane SV wave with a nearly critical angle of incidence, 2) a horizontal line force, 3) a Haskell-type 2D dislocation source, and 4) a Bouchon-type 2D multiple crack source. The results show that the amplification due to the hill relative to the flat surface is more than 1.5 for all the source models. Since this amplification is nearly independent of the source type and spectrum, we conclude that the combined effect of the topographic irregularity and critically incident SV waves might be responsible for the concentration of damage observed during the Whittier Narrows earthquake.},

The injected microcement grout flows through the innate discontinuities present in rock masses and contribute significantly to their mechanical behavior. The deformational characteristics of geological media are affected by the subjected strain levels and state of stress and for jointed rocks, the state of joints (roughness, filling material etc.) also have a significant effect. In this study, the dynamic properties of microcement grouted granitic rocks were analyzed using the rock mass dynamic test (RMDT) apparatus. Resonant column tests were conducted on a regularly spaced, planar jointed granitic rock specimen before and after grouting to analyze the effects of grouting on the strain-dependent shear modulus and damping ratio.},

  abstract = {The Japan islands are in a complex tectonic setting with various subducting plates, and most of their urban areas are located on sedimentary basins. These lead to three-dimensionally complicated velocity structures, which cause significant effects on the propagation of seismic waves from an earthquake to the urban areas. Accordingly, it is important for the simulation of long-period ground motion and its seismic hazard assessment to determine the three-dimensional (3-D) velocity structure of the whole Japan islands. We have already proposed a standard procedure for modeling a regional 3-D velocity structure in Japan, simultaneously and sequentially using various kinds of datasets such as the extensive refraction/reflection experiments, gravity surveys, surface geology, borehole logging data, microtremor surveys, and earthquake ground motion records (Koketsu et al., 2009). We then applied this procedure to northeastern and central Japan in 2009, and to southwestern Japan in 2011. We have now constructed the Version 1 of the Japan Integrated Velocity Structure Model by combining these regional models. Long-period ground motions from future Tokai, Tonankai, Nankai, and Miyagi-oki earthquakes and their response spectra were computed by using this model, and hazard maps were published in 2009 and 2012 based on the results of the computation.},

The aim of this article is to formulate the H/V technique in terms of the characteristics of Rayleigh and Love waves, and to contribute to improve the technique. The improvement includes use of not only peaks but also troughs in the H/V ratio for reliable estimation of the period and use of a newly proposed smoothing function for better estimation of the amplification factor. The formulation leads to a simple formula for the amplification factor expressed with the H/V ratio. With microtremor data measured at 546 junior high schools in 23 wards of Tokyo, the improved technique is applied to mapping site periods and amplification factors in the area.},

We review a set of theoretical site factors derived from equivalent-linear analyses for specific geologic categories in the Los Angeles area and the San Francisco Bay area. The theoretical site factors are a function of the peak horizontal acceleration for the reference rock site condition and the depth to firm material (taken as depth to the 1 km/sec shear-wave isosurface). We apply the site factors to predict the response spectral acceleration of ground motions at recording sites in a manner that mimics how they would typically be used in engineering practice: empirical ground-motion prediction equations are used to estimate a reference (rock) spectrum that is then modified by using the theoretical site factors. Analysis of residuals between the data and model predictions indicates that the theoretical site factors are able to capture the average effects of sediment nonlinearity. The analyses also show that short-period spectral accelerations are underpredicted and that long-period spectral accelerations are overpredicted. The underprediction at short periods may result from overestimation of a soft-to-firm reference rock correction factor that is needed to apply the site factors. The overprediction bias at long periods varies with depth, suggesting that the depth term in the site factors may not fully account for the effect of basin geometry at long periods.},

  abstract = {One-dimensional nonlinear ground response analyses provide a more accurate characterization of the true nonlinear soil behavior than equivalent-linear procedures, but the application of nonlinear codes in practice has been limited, which results in part from poorly documented and unclear parameter selection and code usage protocols. In this article, exact ͑linear frequency-domain͒ solutions for body wave propagation through an elastic medium are used to establish guidelines for two issues that have long been a source of confusion for users of nonlinear codes. The first issue concerns the specification of input motion as “outcropping” ͑i.e., equivalent free-surface motions͒ versus “within” ͑i.e., motions occurring at depth within a site profile͒. When the input motion is recorded at the ground surface ͑e.g., at a rock site͒, the full outcropping ͑rock͒ motion should be used along with an elastic base having a stiffness appropriate for the underlying rock. The second issue concerns the specification of viscous damping ͑used in most nonlinear codes͒ or small-strain hysteretic damping ͑used by one code considered herein͒, either of which is needed for a stable solution at small strains. For a viscous damping formulation, critical issues include the target value of the viscous damping ratio and the frequencies for which the viscous damping produced by the model matches the target. For codes that allow the use of “full” Rayleigh damping ͑which has two target frequencies͒, the target damping ratio should be the small-strain material damping, and the target frequencies should be established through a process by which linear time domain and frequency domain solutions are matched. As a first approximation, the first-mode site frequency and five times that frequency can be used. For codes with different damping models, alternative recommendations are developed.},

  abstract = {Ground motions in the Los Angeles Basin during large earthquakes are modulated by earthquake ruptures, path effects into the basin, basin effects, and local site response. We analyzed the direct effect of shallow basin structures on shaking duration at a period of 2–10 s in the Los Angeles region through modeling small magnitude, shallow, and deep earthquake pairs. The source depth modulates the basin response, particularly the shaking duration, and these features are a function of path effect and not site condition. Three‐dimensional simulations using the CVM‐S4.26.M01 velocity model show good fitting to the initial portion of the waveforms at periods of 5 s and longer but fail to predict the long shaking duration during shallow events, especially at periods less than 5 s. Simulations using CVM‐H do not match the timing of the initial arrivals as well as CVM‐S4.26.M01, and the strong late arrivals in the CVM‐H simulation travel with an apparent velocity slower than observed. A higher‐quality factor than traditionally assumed may produce synthetics with longer durations but is unable to accurately match the amplitude and phase. Beamforming analysis using dense array data further reveals the long duration surface waves have the same back azimuth as the direct arrivals and are generated at the basin edges, while the later coda waves are scattered from off‐azimuth directions, potentially due to strong, sharp boundaries offshore. Improving the description of these shallow basin structures and attenuation model will enhance our capability to predict long‐period ground motions in basins.},

  abstract = {We combine light detection and ranging (LiDAR) digital terrain model (DTM) data and an improved mesh implementation to investigate the effects of high-resolution surface topography on seismic ground motion based upon the spectral-element method. In general, topography increases the amplitude of shaking at mountain tops and ridges, whereas valleys usually have reduced ground motion, as has been observed in both records from past earthquakes and numerical simulations. However, the effects of realistic topography on ground motion have not often been clearly characterized in numerical simulations, especially the seismic response of the true ground surface. Here, we use LiDAR DTM data, which provide two-meter resolution at the free surface, and a spectral-element method to simulate three-dimensional (3D) seismic-wave propagation in the Yangminshan region in Taiwan, incorporating the effects of realistic topography. A smoothed topographic map is employed beneath the model surface in order to decrease mesh distortions due to steep ground surfaces. Numerical simulations show that seismic shaking in mountainous areas is strongly affected by topography and source frequency content. The amplification of ground motion mainly occurs at the tops of hills and ridges whilst the valleys and flat-topped hills experience lower levels of ground shaking. Interaction between small-scale topographic features and high-frequency surface waves can produce unusually strong shaking. We demonstrate that topographic variations can change peak ground acceleration (PGA) values by ±50\% in mountainous areas, and the relative change in PGA between a valley and a ridge can be as high as a factor of 2 compared to a flat surface response. This suggests that high-resolution, realistic topographic features should be taken into account in seismic hazard analysis, especially for densely populated mountainous areas.},

  abstract = {Topography influences ground motion and, in general, increases the amplitude of shaking at mountain tops and ridges, whereas valleys have reduced ground motions, as is observed from data recorded during and after real earthquakes and from numerical simulations. However, recent publications have focused mainly on the implications for ground motion in the mountainous regions themselves, whereas the impact on surrounding low-lying areas has received less attention. Here, we develop a new spectral-element mesh implementation to accommodate realistic topography as well as the complex shape of the Taipei sedimentary basin, which is located close to the Central Mountain Range in northern Taiwan. Spectral-element numerical simulations indicate that high-resolution topography can change peak ground velocity (PGV) values in mountainous areas by ±50\% compared to a half-space response. We further demonstrate that large-scale topography can affect the propagation of seismic waves in nearby areas. For example, if a shallow earthquake occurs in the I-Lan region of Taiwan, the Central Mountain Range will significantly scatter the surface waves and will in turn reduce the amplitude of ground motion in the Taipei basin. However, as the hypocenter moves deeper, topography scatters body waves, which subsequently propagate as surface waves into the basin. These waves continue to interact with the basin and the surrounding mountains, finally resulting in complex amplification patterns in Taipei City, with an overall PGV increase of more than 50\%. For realistic subduction zone earthquake scenarios off the northeast coast of Taiwan, the effects of topography on ground motion in both the mountains and the Taipei basin vary and depend on the rupture process. The complex interactions that can occur between mountains and surrounding areas, especially sedimentary basins, illustrate the fact that topography should be taken into account when assessing seismic hazard.},

In F3DT, the sensitivity (Fréchet) kernels are computed using numerical solutions of the 3-D elastodynamic equation and the nonlinearity of the structural inversion problem is accounted for through an iterative tomographic navigation process. More than half-a-million misfit measurements made on about 38,000 earthquake seismograms and 12,000 ambient-noise correlagrams have been assimilated into our inversion. After 26 F3DT iterations, synthetic seismograms computed using our latest model, CVM-S4.26, show substantially better fit to observed seismograms at frequencies below 0.2 Hz than those computed using our 3-D starting model CVM-S4 and the other SCEC CVM, CVM-H11.9, which was improved through 16 iterations of AW-F3DT. CVM-S4.26 has revealed strong crustal heterogeneities throughout Southern California, some of which are completely missing in CVM-S4 and CVM-H11.9 but exist in models obtained from previous crustal-scale 2-D active-source refraction tomography models. At shallow depths, our model shows strong correlation with sedimentary basins and reveals velocity contrasts across major mapped strike-slip and dip-slip faults. At middle to lower crustal depths, structural features in our model may provide new insights into regional tectonics. When combined with physics-based seismic hazard analysis tools, we expect our model to provide more accurate estimates of seismic hazards in Southern California.},

In the updated seismic velocity model for Southern California, CVM-S4.26, many velocity gradients show consistency with surface geology and major faults defined in the Community Fault Model (CFM) (Plesch et al. 2007), which was constructed by using various geological and geophysical observations. In addition to faults in CFM, CVM-S4.26 reveals a velocity reversal mainly beneath the San Gabriel Mountain and Western Mojave Desert regions, which is correlated with the detachment structure that has also been found in other independent studies. The high-resolution tomographic images of CVM-S4.26 could assist the understanding of fault systems in Southern California and therefore benefit the development of fault models as well as other applications, such as seismic hazard analysis, tectonic reconstructions, and crustal deformation modeling.},

  abstract = {Based on petrophysical data, geologic maps, and a well log, we present statistical descriptions of likely upper-, middle-, and lower-crustal rocks to characterize the fine-scale heterogeneity observed in crustal exposures and inferred from deep-crustal seismic data. The statistical models, developed for granitic and metamorphic upper crust, and for an extended metamorphic lower crust, are used to construct whole-crustal models of seismic velocity heterogenity. We present finite-difference synthetic CMP data from several models which compare favorably with field data. The statistical models also permit classification of the seismic reflection experiment and the crustal heterogeneity according to scattering regime. The “optical”, or scattering properties of importance for classification are the velocity fluctuation intensity, the horizontal and vertical correlation lengths of the medium, the correlation function of the medium, and the velocity population function. For the crustal properties we measured, the bandwidth of a typical deep crustal experiment overlaps from the weak to the strong scattering regime, with implications for crustal seismic data processing and imaging. Notably, deep-crustal signals are likely to have experienced multiple scattering, making common seismic imaging techniques of questionable value. Moreover, the details of the unmigrated CMP stacked section bears little resemblance to the underlying medium.},

  abstract = {Since Conrad [1925] first identified a midcrustal refraction event in central Europe seismologists have developed layered models of the continental crust with velocity steps at various levels. Modern analysis of crustal refraction data, including automated inversion, relies on ray theoretical techniques or wave theory for plane layered media, which generally parameterize the Earth as a series of grossly horizontal layers. The bias toward layered models is in part based on physical and geologic intuition, but it is to a large measure a result of available interpretation methods, for example layer-based reflectivity and ray tracing methods. In contrast, reflection seismology has produced a picture of a highly heterogeneous crust, with wavelength-scale variations in velocity existing at different levels of the crust in different tectonic regimes. Finite difference modeling shows that zones of small amplitude random velocity fluctuations not only produce short discontinuous reflection segments as observed on deep seismic reflection data but also produce strong wide-angle reflections. Some of the events identified as crustal wide-angle reflections in field data may in fact be the result of scattering from wavelength-scale heterogeneities and need not result from reflection from a first- or second- order velocity discontinuity. Significant changes in the large-scale velocity structure associated with zones of random velocity fluctuations produce relatively small changes in the dynamic properties of the backscattered wave field. This observation is in disagreement with the common credo that the seismic refraction method is primarily sensitive to changes in the large-scale velocity structure. As a consequence, the ray theoretical interpretation of such wide-angle reflections as first-order discontinuities leads to crustal velocity structures that are nonunique and may be erroneous in detail, while correctly predicting average crustal velocity and thickness. We are not suggesting that crustal velocity does not change with depth on the large-scale; rather, we are proposing that crustal seismic events observed at intermediate and large offsets may be the result of scattering from wavelength-scale velocity fabric rather than specular reflection or refraction from first-order discontinuities.},

Seven instrumented downhole arrays in California and Japan were studied using 41 recorded ground motions that cover a broad range of intensities. The arrays were initially assessed in terms of effectiveness of 1-D SRA using taxonomy screening. Furthermore, LS-DYNA, an advanced Finite Element (FE) program, was employed to develop the 1-D soil column models for the SRA of these arrays. The soil stress-strain behavior was characterized with three different models including one linear elastic and two nonlinear backbone curve formulations. All predictions were compared to the measured ground motions to quantify the model biases and uncertainties. Lastly, the practical limitations of 1-D SRA models considered herein are identified, and recommendations are provided to assess the usefulness of the predictions in engineering practice.},

  abstract = {Accurate models of crustal attenuation structure are important for simulating seismic wavefields at high frequencies (f {$>$} 1 Hz). In this study, we collected P and S waveforms from 160 regional earthquakes (3.3 ≤ M ≤ 5.7) recorded at 218 broadband stations of Southern California Seismic Network and measured spectral amplitudes of P and S waves in the 1- to 10-Hz band using integrals over wavelet transforms. We accounted for source structure and geometrical spreading by referencing the spectral amplitudes to values computed from 1-D synthetic seismograms. We inverted the spectral amplitude ratios for a 1-D, frequency-dependent crustal attenuation model. When plotted against wavenumber, the depth averages of both QP and QS are described by the same function, Q(k) = (240 ± 20) k0.40 ± 0.05 (1 km−1 ≤ k ≤ 17 km−1). Our results are consistent with attenuation dominated by first-order Born scattering from an isotropic, self-affine distribution of elastic heterogeneities with an outer scale of 10 km, a root-mean-square relative amplitude of 8\% and a fractal dimension of 3.8. The inversions accounted for frequency-dependent variations in the source spectra and site response. The source spectra roll off at an average rate of about 2 for both wave types. The station residuals, which reflect unresolved lateral structure, show stronger attenuation in the Los Angeles region and weaker attenuation in the batholithic terrains to the north and south, as well as in the Proterozoic terrains on the eastern side of the study region.},

  abstract = {We present a new crustal seismic velocity model for southern California derived from P and S arrival times from local earthquakes and explosions. To reduce the volume of data and ensure a more uniform source distribution, we compute “composite event” picks for 2597 distributed master events that include pick information for other events within spheres of 2 km radius. The approach reduces random picking error and maximizes the number of S wave picks. To constrain absolute event locations and shallow velocity structure, we also use times from controlled sources, including both refraction shots and quarries. We implement the SIMULPS tomography algorithm to obtain three-dimensional (3-D) Vp and Vp/Vs structure and hypocenter locations of the composite events. Our new velocity model in general agrees with previous studies, resolving low-velocity features at shallow depths in the basins and some high-velocity features in the midcrust. Using our velocity model and 3-D ray tracing, we relocate about 450,000 earthquakes from 1981 to 2005. We observe a weak correlation between seismic velocities and earthquake occurrence, with shallow earthquakes mostly occurring in high P velocity regions and midcrustal earthquakes occurring in low P velocity regions. In addition, most seismicity occurs in regions with relatively low Vp/Vs ratios, although aftershock sequences following large earthquakes are often an exception to this pattern.},

For linear wave propagation problem approximation together with stability delivers convergence of the same order as approximation. If a wave propagation proses is considered convergence to a plane wave solution can be derived analytically by means of the dispersion analysis. However, mentioned techniques are applicable only to homogeneous media and provide no knowledge of reflection/transmission coefficients. In this paper we prove that the only way to get second order accuracy of the solution for media with discontinuous parameters is to use a conservative finite difference scheme of the second order, and the only way to do this is to use the arithmetic mean for the density and the harmonic mean for the bulk modulus in the vicinity of the interface.},

  abstract = {Shear-wave velocities (VS) are widely used for earthquake ground-motion site characterization. VS data are now largely obtained using borehole methods. Drilling holes, however, is expensive. Nonintrusive surface methods are inexpensive for obtaining VS information, but not many comparisons with direct borehole measurements have been published. Because different assumptions are used in data interpretation of each surface method and public safety is involved in site characterization for engineering structures, it is important to validate the surface methods by additional comparisons with borehole measurements. We compare results obtained from a particular surface method (array measurement of surface waves associated with microtremor) with results obtained from borehole methods. Using a 10-element nested-triangular array of 100-m aperture, we measured surface-wave phase velocities at two California sites, Garner Valley near Hemet and Hollister Municipal Airport. The Garner Valley site is located at an ancient lake bed where water-saturated sediment overlies decomposed granite on top of granite bedrock. Our array was deployed at a location where seismic velocities had been determined to a depth of 500 m by borehole methods. At Hollister, where the near-surface sediment consists of clay, sand, and gravel, we determined phase velocities using an array located close to a 60-m deep borehole where downhole velocity logs already exist. Because we want to assess the measurements uncomplicated by uncertainties introduced by the inversion process, we compare our phase-velocity results with the borehole VS depth profile by calculating fundamental-mode Rayleigh-wave phase velocities from an earth model constructed from the borehole data. For wavelengths less than ∼2 times of the array aperture at Garner Valley, phase-velocity results from array measurements agree with the calculated Rayleigh-wave velocities to better than 11\%. Measurement errors become larger for wavelengths 2 times greater than the array aperture. At Hollister, the measured phase velocity at 3.9 Hz (near the upper edge of the microtremor frequency band) is within 20\% of the calculated Rayleigh-wave velocity. Because shear-wave velocity is the predominant factor controlling Rayleigh-wave phase velocities, the comparisons suggest that this nonintrusive method can provide VS information adequate for ground-motion estimation.},

  abstract = {We present a new method for calculating broadband time histories of  ground motion based on a hybrid low-frequency/high-frequency approach with correlated  source parameters. Using a finite-difference method we calculate low- frequency synthetics (\&lt; ∼1 Hz) in a 3D velocity structure. We also compute broadband  synthetics in a 1D velocity model using a frequency-wavenumber method. The  low frequencies from the 3D calculation are combined with the high frequencies  from the 1D calculation by using matched filtering at a crossover frequency of 1 Hz.  The source description, common to both the 1D and 3D synthetics, is based on  correlated random distributions for the slip amplitude, rupture velocity, and rise time  on the fault. This source description allows for the specification of source parameters  independent of any a priori inversion results. In our broadband modeling we include  correlation between slip amplitude, rupture velocity, and rise time, as suggested by  dynamic fault modeling. The method of using correlated random source parameters  is flexible and can be easily modified to adjust to our changing understanding of  earthquake ruptures. A realistic attenuation model is common to both the 3D and 1D  calculations that form the low- and high-frequency components of the broadband  synthetics. The value of Q is a function of the local shear-wave velocity. To produce  more accurate high-frequency amplitudes and durations, the 1D synthetics are corrected  with a randomized, frequency-dependent radiation pattern. The 1D synthetics  are further corrected for local site and nonlinear soil effects by using a 1D nonlinear  propagation code and generic velocity structure appropriate for the site’s National  Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (nehrp) site classification. The entire procedure  is validated by comparison with the 1994 Northridge, California, strong  ground motion data set. The bias and error found here for response spectral acceleration  are similar to the best results that have been published by others for the  Northridge rupture.},

The validations of accuracy and efficiency show that this method can solve 3-D seismic response of a large-scale hill topography for broadband waves, and overcome the weakness of large storage and low efficiency of the traditional IBEM. Based on this new algorithm architecture, taking the broadband scattering of plane SV waves by a large-scale Gaussian-shaped hill of thousands-meters height as an example, the influence of several important parameters is investigated, including the incident frequency, the incident angle and the height-width and length-width ratio of the hill. The numerical results illustrate that the amplification effect on the ground motion by a near-hemispherical hill is more significant than the narrow hill. For low-frequency waves, the scattering effect of the higher hill is more pronounced, and there is only a single peak near the top of the hill. However, for high-frequency waves, rapid spatial variation of displacement amplitude appears on the hill surface.},

  abstract = {A method is proposed for accurately describing arbitrary-shaped free boundaries in single-grid finite-difference schemes for elastodynamics, in a time-domain velocity-stress framework. The basic idea is as follows: fictitious values of the solution are built in vacuum, and injected into the numerical integration scheme near boundaries. The most original feature of this method is the way in which these fictitious values are calculated. They are based on boundary conditions and compatibility conditions satisfied by the successive spatial derivatives of the solution, up to a given order that depends on the spatial accuracy of the integration scheme adopted. Since the work is mostly done during the preprocessing step, the extra computational cost is negligible. Stress-free conditions can be designed at any arbitrary order without any numerical instability, as numerically checked. Using 10 grid nodes per minimal S-wavelength with a propagation distance of 50 wavelengths yields highly accurate results. With 5 grid nodes per minimal S-wavelength, the solution is less accurate but still acceptable. A subcell resolution of the boundary inside the Cartesian meshing is obtained, and the spurious diffractions induced by staircase descriptions of boundaries are avoided. Contrary to what occurs with the vacuum method, the quality of the numerical solution obtained with this method is almost independent of the angle between the free boundary and the Cartesian meshing.},

  abstract = {We have developed an open-source software package, Open-source Seismic Wave Propagation Code (OpenSWPC), for parallel numerical simulations of seismic wave propagation in 3D and 2D (P-SV and SH) viscoelastic media based on the finite difference method in local-to-regional scales. This code is equipped with a frequency-independent attenuation model based on the generalized Zener body and an efficient perfectly matched layer for absorbing boundary condition. A hybrid-style programming using OpenMP and the Message Passing Interface (MPI) is adopted for efficient parallel computation. OpenSWPC has wide applicability for seismological studies and great portability to allowing excellent performance from PC clusters to supercomputers. Without modifying the code, users can conduct seismic wave propagation simulations using their own velocity structure models and the necessary source representations by specifying them in an input parameter file. The code has various modes for different types of velocity structure model input and different source representations such as single force, moment tensor and plane-wave incidence, which can easily be selected via the input parameters. Widely used binary data formats, the Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) and the Seismic Analysis Code (SAC) are adopted for the input of the heterogeneous structure model and the outputs of the simulation results, so users can easily handle the input/output datasets. All codes are written in Fortran 2003 and are available with detailed documents in a public repository.},

We show a specific example studying the effect of the San Gabriel Mountains, which are bounded by the Mojave segment of the San Andreas fault on the north and by the Los Angeles Basin on the south. By simulating a Mw~7.5 earthquake on the Mojave segment of the San Andreas fault, we show that the San Gabriel Mountains act as a natural seismic insulator for metropolitan Los Angeles. The topography of the mountains scatters the surface waves generated by the rupture on the San Andreas fault, leading to less-efficient excitation of basin-edge generated waves and natural resonances within the Los Angeles Basin. The effect of the mountains reduces the peak amplitude of ground velocity for some regions in the basin by as much as 50\% in the frequency band up to 0.5~Hz. These results suggest that, depending on the relative location of faulting and the nearby large-scale topography, the topography can shield some areas from ground shaking.},

Outside of the basins, the model crust is based on regional tomographic results. The model Moho is represented by a surface with the depths determined by the receiver function technique.

  abstract = {We present a new hybrid approach to simulate elastic P-SV wave propagation. The method combines a low-order finite-element method (FEM) with a fourth-order velocity–stress staggered-grid finite-difference method (FDM). The FEM is applied to boundaries such as the free surface and fault surface where the FDM has difficulty accounting for the boundary conditions. The FDM is used to propagate waves in the interior regions where the fourth-order staggered-grid FDM is more efficient than the FEM. A minimum of 12 and 6 points per wavelength are used in the regions modeled by the FEM and FDM, respectively. To couple the FDM and FEM, a strong interface, which is 3 or 4 finite-difference grid spacings wide, is constructed between the regions modeled by the FDM and FEM using a newly derived high-order interpolation scheme. The accuracy and efficiency of the interface and the new scheme were tested (1) by simulating a Lamb’s problem and (2) by simulating a kinematic propagating rupture on a 45Њ-dipping fault. Comparisons of results with analytical solutions and those obtained using independent numerical methods show exceptional agreement. We show that in terms of efficiency and memory requirement the hybrid approach is comparable to the fourth-order velocity–stress staggered-grid FDM but greatly expands its applicability by providing an accurate method for dealing with complicated boundary conditions.},

  abstract = {Geological faults comprise large-scale segmentation and small-scale roughness. These multi-scale geometrical complexities determine the dynamics of the earthquake rupture process, and therefore affect the radiated seismic wavefield. In this study, we examine how different parameterizations of fault roughness lead to variability in the rupture evolution and the resulting near-fault ground motions. Rupture incoherence naturally induced by fault roughness generates high-frequency radiation that follows an x-2 decay in displacement amplitude spectra. Because dynamic rupture simulations are computationally expensive, we test several kinematic source approximations designed to emulate the observed dynamic behavior. When simplifying the rough-fault geometry, we find that perturbations in local moment tensor orientation are important, while perturbations in local source location are not. Thus, a planar fault can be assumed if the local strike, dip, and rake are maintained. We observe that dynamic rake angle variations are anti-correlated with the local dip angles. Testing two parameterizations of dynamically consistent Yoffe-type source-time function, we show that the seismic wavefield of the approximated kinematic ruptures well reproduces the radiated seismic waves of the complete dynamic source process. This finding opens a new avenue for an improved pseudo-dynamic source characterization that captures the effects of fault roughness on earthquake rupture evolution. By including also the correlations between kinematic source parameters, we outline a new pseudo-dynamic rupture modeling approach for broadband ground-motion simulation.},

Site-specific HF-scattering Green’s functions for a heterogeneous medium with uniformly distributed random isotropic scatterers are convolved with a source-time function that characterizes the temporal evolution of the rupture process. These scatterograms are then reconciled with the LF-deterministic waveforms using a frequency-domain optimization to match both amplitude and phase spectra around the target intersection frequency. The scattering parameters of the medium, scattering attenuation ηs, intrinsic attenuation ηi, and site-kappa, as well as frequency-dependent attenuation, determine waveform and spectral character of the HF-synthetics and thus affect the hybrid broadband seismograms. Applying our methodology to the 1994 Northridge earthquake and validating against near-field recordings at 24 sites, we find that our technique provides realistic broadband waveforms and consistently reproduces LF ground-motion intensities for two independent source descriptions. The least biased results, compared to recorded strong-motion data, are obtained after applying a frequency-dependent site-amplification factor to the broadband simulations. This innovative hybrid ground-motion simulation approach, applicable to any arbitrarily complex earthquake source model, is well suited for seismic hazard analysis and ground-motion estimation.},

Stresses in the crust are depth-dependent and material response is governed by the Drucker-Prager yielding criterion. I show that material yielding induced by seismic waves under the low confining pressure causes widespread near-surface damage. Because the confining pressure increases with depth, the yielding zone at depth is narrowly confined near the fault, but its thickness broadens dramatically near the surface, forming a “flower-like” damage zone. The fault zone damage at depth is induced by large dynamic stresses associated with the rupture front, while is induced by strong seismic waves ahead of the rupture front near the Earth's surface. These results have important implications for the formation and evolution of fault zones and possibly for the dynamic triggering of earthquakes as well.},

The current national seismic maps do not account for the effects of these basins on the risk-targeted Maximum Considered Earthquake (MCER). The simulated motions for Seattle had large spectral accelerations (at a period of 2 s, 43\% of simulated M9 motions exceeded the MCER), damaging spectral shapes (particularly at periods near 1 s), and long durations (5\%–95\% significant durations near 110 s). For periods of 1 s or longer, the resulting deformation demands and collapse likelihood for four sets of single-degree-of-freedom systems exceeded the corresponding values for motions consistent with the conditional mean spectra at the MCER intensity (MCER). The regional variation of damage was estimated by combining probabilistic characterizations of the seismic resistance of structures and of the effective spectral acceleration, Sa,eff, which accounts for the effects of spectral acceleration, spectral shape, and ground-motion duration. For high-strength, low-ductility systems located above deep basins (Z2.5 {$>$} 6 km), the likelihood of collapse during an M9 earthquake averaged 13\% and 18\% at 1.0 s and 2.0 s periods, respectively. For low-strength, high-ductility systems, the corresponding likelihoods of collapse averaged 18\% and 7\%.},

We give several test cases that demonstrate the method solving 2-D elastic wave equation problems to 4th-order accuracy, even in the presence of smoothly-curved interfaces with jump discontinuities in the model parameters.},

  abstract = {From March to September 2009, a velocimetric network was installed in Narni, central Italy, a village on the top of a limestone ridge. The aim was to investigate local site effects due to the 220-m-high ridge, which is characterized by slopes ranging from 22° to 35°. To investigate amplification without and with a reference site, three stations were installed at the base of the hill and seven at the crest. The network recorded 702 earthquakes, many of them from the 2009 L’Aquila sequence. To determine the dependence of amplification on the morphological features, the spectra were computed for horizontal components rotated into a range of azimuths. Both the ratio of the horizontal-to-vertical-component spectra and the ratio of the spectra at the ridge crest with respect to a reference station at the base of the ridge showed amplification by a factor of circa 4.5 for frequencies between 4~Hz and 5~Hz. The highest amplifications were seen for the directions of the ground motion perpendicular to the main elongation of the ridge. Finally, considering events with an epicentral distance less than 30~km, empirical ground-motion models were calibrated for maximum horizontal peak ground acceleration (PGA), velocity, and acceleration response spectra (5\% damping) up to 1~s, to estimate the site-corrective coefficients for topographic amplification. The data show corrective coefficients between 0.35 and 0.48 (log 10 scale; amplification, 2.2–3.0) for the spectral ordinates between 0.2~s and 0.3~s.},

An overview of topographic effects based on experimental observations and numerical modelling is presented with the aim of highlighting meaning and causes of these phenomena as well as possible correlations between site response (fundamental frequency, amplification level) and geometrical (width and shape ratio of a relief) parameters. After a thorough summary of topographic effects, the paper focuses on five Italian sites whose seismic response is potentially affected by local morphology, as already evidenced by previous studies. In this study, seismic data recorded at these sites are analysed computing directional spectral ratios both in terms of horizontal to vertical spectral ratios (HVSRs) and, wherever possible, in terms of standard spectral ratios (SSRs). The analysis lead to the conclusion that wavefield tends to be polarized along a direction perpendicular to the main axis of a topographic irregularity, direction along which ground motion amplification is maximum. The final section of the article compares and contrasts different spectral ratio techniques in order to examine their effectiveness and reliability in detecting topographic effects. The examples discussed in the paper show that site responses based on HVSRs rather than SSR measurements could lead to misinterpretation of ground response results, both as concerns the definition of the site fundamental frequency and amplification level.},

Second-, fourth-, and sixth-order finite difference schemes are considered. The resulting schemes are fully explicit. Accuracy and numerical stability of the proposed schemes are demonstrated for both linear and nonlinear hyperbolic systems in one and two spatial dimensions.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new methodology to predict the topographic site-effect amplification. Ground motions obtained from a large database of 3D earthquake simulations show that the curvature of the Earth’s surface, defined as the second spatial derivative of the elevation map, is correlated with the topographic site amplification. The highest correlation between the frequency-dependent topographic amplification and the topographic curvature is reached when the curvature is smoothed over a characteristic length equal to the S wavelength divided by two (i.e., frequency-scaled curvature [FSC]). This implies the amplification is caused by topographic features for which horizontal dimensions are similar to half of the S wavelength. The largest ground-motion variabilities are found at sites located on slopes and on the largest summits, whereas intermediate variabilities occur over narrow ridges and a stable behavior in the bottom valleys. The FSC proxy allows the identification of topographic features with similar characteristic dimensions and probabilistic estimates of amplification values accounting on the variability of ground motions due to source–site interactions. Amplification estimates using the FSC proxy are robust and easily computed from digital elevation maps provided that reasonable values of S-wave velocities are available in the area of interest.},

We show for both isotropic and double-couple point sources that a 94\% reduction in the number of stations of a regularly spaced array yields MRM site-effect estimates within 5\% of those obtained from the absolute regional median, and within 20\% using a 98\% station reduction with irregularly located sites. In contrast, the SRM yielded site-effect overestimates greater than 50\% in some areas and up to 100\% in specific sites, which makes the MRM much more robust than the SRM. We determined a 33\% probability to exceed an amplification factor of 2, and an 8\% probability to exceed a factor of 3 due to topography in the surroundings of the sharpest summit of the LSBB area.},

  abstract = {Reliable ground-motion prediction for future earthquakes depends on the ability to simulate realistic earthquake source models. Though dynamic rupture calculations have recently become more popular, they are still computationally demanding. An alternative is to invoke the framework of pseudodynamic (PD) source characterizations that use simple relationships between kinematic and dynamic source parameters to build physically self-consistent kinematic models. Based on the PD approach of Guatteri et al. (2004), we propose new relationships for PD models for moderate-to-large strike-slip earthquakes that include local supershear rupture speed due to stress heterogeneities. We conduct dynamic rupture simulations using stochastic initial stress distributions to generate a suite of source models in the magnitude Mw 6–8. This set of models shows that local supershear rupture speed prevails for all earthquake sizes, and that the local rise-time distribution is not controlled by the overall fault geometry, but rather by local stress changes on the faults. Based on these findings, we derive a new set of relations for the proposed PD source characterization that accounts for earthquake size, buried and surface ruptures, and includes local risetime variations and supershear rupture speed. By applying the proposed PD source characterization to several well-recorded past earthquakes, we verify that significant improvements in fitting synthetic ground motion to observed ones is achieved when comparing our new approach with the model of Guatteri et al. (2004). The proposed PD methodology can be implemented into ground-motion simulation tools for more physically reliable prediction of shaking in future earthquakes.},

  abstract = {Damage surrounding the core of faults is represented by deformation on a range of scales from microfracturing of the rock matrix to macroscopic fracture networks. The spatial distribution and geometric characterization of damage at various scales can help to predict fault growth processes, subsequent mechanics, bulk hydraulic and seismological properties of a fault zone. Within the excellently exposed Atacama fault system, northern Chile, micro- and macroscale fracture densities and orientation surrounding strike-slip faults with well-constrained displacements ranging over nearly 5 orders of magnitude (∼0.12m–5000m) have been analyzed. Faults have been studied that cut granodiorite and have been passively exhumed from 6 to 10km depth. This allows direct comparison of the damage surrounding faults of different displacements. The faults consist of a fault core and associated damage zone. Macrofractures in the damage zone are predominantly shear fractures orientated at high angles to the faults studied. They have a reasonably well-defined exponential decrease with distance from the fault core. Microfractures are a combination of open, healed, partially healed and fluid inclusion planes (FIPs). FIPs are the earliest set of fractures and show an exponential decrease in fracture density with perpendicular distance from the fault core. Later microfractures do not show a clear relationship of microfracture density with perpendicular distance from the fault core. Damage zone widths defined by the density of FIPs scale with fault displacement but appear to reach a maximum at a fewkm displacement. One fault, where damage was characterized on both sides of the fault core shows no damage asymmetry. All faults appear to have a critical microfracture density at the fault core/damage zone boundary that is independent of displacement. An empirical relationship for microfracture density distribution with displacement is presented. Preferred FIP orientations have a high angle to the fault close to the fault core and become more diffuse with distance. Models that predict off-fault damage such as a migrating process zone during fault formation, wear from geometrical irregularities and dynamic rupture are all consistent with our data. We conclude it is very difficult to distinguish between them on the basis of field data alone, at least within the limits of this study.},

  abstract = {The 2007 Chuetsu-oki, Japan, earthquake is the world’s first major earthquake upon a source fault that extends beneath a nuclear power plant and is also characterized by difficulty determining the source fault plane. Centroid Moment Tensor solutions indicate an Mw 6.6 reverse-faulting crustal earthquake with conjugate fault planes dipping to the northwest and southeast. Early results of aftershock locations suggest that either northwest-dipping plane or southeast-dipping plane can be the source fault plane of this earthquake. We carried out source inversions and empirical Green’s function simulations of observed seismograms; however, they resulted in similar waveform residuals for the two fault planes. We then determined the relative locations of earthquake asperities to the hypocenter using travel-time differences of strong-motion pulses and relocated the aftershocks observed by ocean bottom seismometers deployed in the source region. These results imply that slips mainly occurred on the southeast-dipping fault plane. This implication was later confirmed by results of reflection surveys. During the earthquake, the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant experienced stronger ground motions than those anticipated at the time of design. The ground motions consist of three seismic pulses that correspond to three asperities. The first and second pulses arose from rupture propagation to the plant, while the compact asperity on the distant southeast-dipping fault plane and its S-wave radiation pattern are responsible for the significant third pulse.},

Accelerograms observed at the dense seismometer array in the plant are now open to the public and will provide valuable knowledge. The temporal changes of S-wave velocity were examined by using normalized input–output minimization (NIOM) method based on the vertical array records observed during the mainshock and the events before and after it. It was found that the S-wave velocity in the layers (surface–50 m depth and 50–100 m depth) decreased significantly during the principal motion of the mainshock (indicating nonlinear behavior), whereas nearly linear behavior was observed in the bedrock layer (below 100 m depth). It was also found that the S-wave velocity increased in the layers above 100 m depth soon after this motion, indicating no major liquefaction in these layers. Finally, the relationship between the shear modulus and shear strain was examined based on the obtained S-wave velocities. The normalized shear moduli (G=G0) in the surface and intermediate layers decreased to about 0.2 at a strain level of 1 × 10 3 to 1 × 10 2 and about 0.6 at a strain level of 1 × 10 3 to 2 × 10 3.},

Quantifying the uncertainty in VS30 measurements is important for determining the accuracy and precision of this geophysical test. This study gathers existing available comparative and blind shear-wave velocity tests to evaluate the apparent or observable intraand intermethod variability. Presented in this article are estimates of VS30 uncertainty for the invasive methods of downhole, suspension logging, and seismic cone penetration testing, the noninvasive method of spectral analysis of surface waves, and the method of shear-wave velocity correlated geologic units. Discussed is the issue of soil disturbance with respect to invasive methods and how this may result in measurement bias. Results of this study indicate that uncertainty of shear-wave velocity measurements are on the order of 1\%–3\% coefficient of variation (standard deviation/mean) for downhole, suspension logging, and seismic cone penetration testing, 5\%–6\% coefficient of variation for spectral analysis of surface waves, and 20\%–35\% coefficient of variation for shear-wave velocity correlated geologic units. Presented here are procedures for propagating the uncertainty and/or bias in forward analyses.},

An earlier paper described an approach for modelling irregular boundaries in a constant-density acoustic finite-difference code, based on the second-order formulation of the wave equation that only involves the pressure. Here, a similar method is considered for the first-order formulation in terms of pressure and particle velocity, using a staggered finite-difference discretization both in space and in time. In one space dimension, the boundary conditions consist in imposing antisymmetry for the pressure and symmetry for particle velocity components. For the pressure, this means that the solution values as well as all even derivatives up to a certain order are zero on the boundary. For the particle velocity, all odd derivatives are zero. In 2D, the 1-D assumption is used along each coordinate direction, with antisymmetry for the pressure along the coordinate and symmetry for the particle velocity component parallel to that coordinate direction. Since the symmetry or antisymmetry should hold along the direction normal to the boundary rather than along the coordinate directions, this generates an additional numerical error on top of the time stepping errors and the errors due to the interior spatial discretization. Numerical experiments in 2D and 3D nevertheless produce acceptable results.},

Some of the conventional staggered-grid finite-difference method (FDM) simulations use a simplified structure model without a seawater layer and with a flat ocean-bottom topography. In this study, we apply our heterogeneity, oceanic layer, and topography scheme (HOT)-FDM and a 3D structure model including land and ocean-bottom topographies, a seawater layer, and a fluid–solid boundary condition to an aftershock (Mw 5.8) of the 2009 Suruga Bay earthquake. We attempt to reproduce observations at seismic stations near the coast and then simulate waveforms in the ocean-bottom stations. Our results show that a large difference between the cases with and without topographies can be seen in the coda part after the S wave in the simulated waveforms in terms of amplitudes and elongations. The synthetic waveforms in the model with topographies are in agreement with the observed waveforms. Our results also show that a significant difference in the amplification of the coda part between the cases with and without the seawater layer can be found at the ocean-bottom stations. This coda part is the S- and Rayleigh-wave propagation associated with the ocean and the underlying sediment layers. Our results show that a realistic model with topographies and a seawater layer is needed in FDM simulations in order to precisely reproduce observed waveforms or predict seismic motion for a suboceanic earthquake.},

  abstract = {HVSR, known as the Nakamura method, was developed to reduce the influence of Rayleigh waves for a spectrum HHSR to estimate the seismic response at the ground surface versus that at a reference bedrock site, and is not used to characterize a Rayleigh-wave spectrum. Although misunderstandings and confusion are caused by the similar shape of each HVSR, I reiterate here the Nakamura method differs from methods to determine the characteristics of Rayleigh waves, and the target frequency range is also different. The intended frequency range of the Nakamura method is around F 0, which is the resonance frequency of the multiply reflected SH waves in the surface layer. Of course, the frequency range can be extended if the impact of Rayleigh waves is less, as for earthquake signals. On the other hand, the intended frequency range of methods for characterizing Rayleigh waves is greater than F 0 and generally more than 2F 0. I am conscious the Nakamura method is only one of the tools to estimate the resonance frequency and the amplification factor at the site. Although this is an available tool to estimate roughly the amplification factor with dispersion inherently, and it is possible to pick out a ground with relatively high risk based on the result of estimation, this is absolutely one of the engineering tools. I think this is not considered a scientific tool for theoretical exploration or pursuit of truth. On the other hand, I would like to add a remark that it is possible from the characteristics of the Nakamura method to estimate not only the resonance frequency and amplification factor of a surface layer using HVSR at ground surface but also the resonance frequency and the amplification factor of both buildings and ground using HVSR at the top of a building.},

  abstract = {In a realistic geological structure with a large contrast in seismic wavespeed between shallow and deep regions, simulation of seismic wave propagation using a spatially uniform grid can be computationally very demanding, due to overdiscretization of the high-speed material. Thus, numerical methods that allow for coarser discretization of the faster regions have the potential to be much more efficient. Discontinuous mesh (DM) methods, operating by exchanging wavefield information between media partitions discretized with two different grid spacings, provide a convenient way to improve such efficiency issues. Unfortunately, discontinuous staggered-grid finite-difference (FD) methods typically suffer from inherent stability problems, in particular in strongly heterogeneous media, arising from numerical noise generated at the overlap of the two regions with different grid spacing. We have developed a 3D fourth-order velocity-stress staggered-grid FD DM anelastic wave propagation method (AWP-DM) for seismic wavefield estimation using a discontinuous mesh interface (WEDMI) between fine and coarse meshes. Benchmarks in models with realistic 3D velocity variations and finite-fault sources across the grid interface show stable results for a number of timesteps, exceeding the need dictated by current high-frequency ground-motion simulations. In the case of a factor-of-three ratio between the coarse and fine grid sizes, this method is capable of producing a level of accuracy comparable to that from the uniform fine-grid scheme, using at least 7–8 grid points per minimum S wavelength inside the mesh overlap zone.},

  abstract = {High-frequency controlled-source seismic sections with dense spatial sampling show the existence of heterogeneity at different depth levels of the continental crust and upper mantle. Our sources of information are the Peaceful Nuclear Explosion (PNE) seismic data sets recorded to large offsets in the former Soviet Union supplemented by recordings from the North American Early Rise deep seismic experiment and normal-incidence reflection seismic sections collected in northwest Europe. Heterogeneity in the crust and upper mantle can be uniquely identified in reversed high-frequency (2–10 Hz) PNE seismic sections collected with dense spatial sampling (nominal receiver spacing of 10–15 km) out to 4000 km offset. We document pronounced seismic scattering from three heterogeneous zones: The lower crust from ∼20 km to ∼40 km depth, an ∼80 km thick low-velocity zone below ∼100 km depth, and the ∼320–460 km depth interval around the top of the mantle transition zone. We calculate the full seismic wavefield in heterogeneous crust–mantle models with a two-dimensional finite-difference algorithm. We represent the heterogeneous layers by random fluctuations of the elastic parameters and Q-values. The spatial (horizontal and vertical) correlation lengths and the standard deviation of the scattering media are constrained by comparison of observed and calculated seismic sections. The lower crustal heterogeneity causes a coda to the upper mantle arrivals at all recorded frequencies. This coda is a prominent feature for whispering-gallery phases (teleseismic Pn), which travel as multiply reflected refractions below the Moho to more than 3000 km offset from the PNE sources. The heterogeneous mantle low-velocity zone causes a scattered coda trailing the first arrivals in the ∼800–1400 km offset range. The best fit to the observations along profile Kraton in Siberia is obtained by an 80 km thick heterogeneous low-velocity zone below 100 km depth, represented by fluctuations described by a von Karman distribution function with a Hurst number of 0.5 and spatial correlation lengths of 5–10 km (horizontally) and 3–5 km (vertically). Scattered arrivals, which trail the reflection from the ‘410’ discontinuity and a reflection from a shallower depth of ∼320 km, constrain heterogeneity around the top of the transition zone. This heterogeneity is modelled by fluctuations in the 320–460 km depth interval with correlation lengths on the order of 20–40 km by 5–10 km. Scattering from the two shallower heterogeneous zones improves the description of the phases from around the transition zone.},

  abstract = {We model ruptures on faults that weaken in response to flash heating of microscopic asperity contacts (within a rate-and-state framework) and thermal pressurization of pore fluid. These are arguably the primary weakening mechanisms on mature faults at coseismic slip rates, at least prior to large slip accumulation. Ruptures on strongly rate-weakening faults take the form of slip pulses or cracks, depending on the background stress. Self-sustaining slip pulses exist within a narrow range of stresses: below this range, artificially nucleated ruptures arrest; above this range, ruptures are crack-like. Natural earthquakes will occur as slip pulses if faults operate at the minimum stress required for propagation. Using laboratory-based flash heating parameters, propagation is permitted when the ratio of shear to effective normal stress on the fault is 0.2–0.3; this is mildly influenced by reasonable choices of hydrothermal properties. The San Andreas and other major faults are thought to operate at such stress levels. While the overall stress level is quite small, the peak stress at the rupture front is consistent with static friction coefficients of 0.6–0.9. Growing slip pulses have stress drops of ∼3 MPa; slip and the length of the slip pulse increase linearly with propagation distance at ∼0.14 and ∼30 m/km, respectively. These values are consistent with seismic and geologic observations. In contrast, cracks on faults of the same rheology have stress drops exceeding 20 MPa, and slip at the hypocenter increases with distance at ∼1 m/km.},

  author = {Ohminato, Takao and Chouet, Bernard A},
  pages = {22},
  abstract = {A flexible and simple way of introducing stress-free boundary conditions for including three-dimensional (3D) topography in the finite-difference method is presented. The 3D topography is discretized in a staircase by stacking unit material cells in a staggered-grid scheme. The shear stresses are distributed on the 12 edges of the unit material cell so that only shear stresses appear on the free surface and normal stresses always remain embedded within the solid region. This configuration makes it possible to implement stress-free boundary conditions at the free surface by setting the Lam6 coefficients 2 and \# to zero without generating any physically unjustified condition. Arbitrary 3D topographies are realized by changing the distribution of )\textasciitilde{} and/z in the computational domain. Our method uses a parsimonious staggered-grid scheme that requires only 3/4 of the memory used in the conventional staggered-grid scheme in which six stress components and three velocity components need to be stored. Numerical tests indicate that 25 grids per wavelength are required for stable calculation. The finite-difference results are compared with those of the boundary-element method for the two-dimensional (2D) semi-circular canyon model. We also present the responses of a segment of semi-circular canyon and hemispherical cavity to vertically incident plane P, SV, and S H waves and discuss the response of a Gaussian hill to an isotropic point source embedded in the hill. In the segment of semi-circular canyon, the later portions of the synthetics are characterized by phases scattered from the two vertical side walls. The hemispherical cavity and 2D semi-circular canyon both show focusing of energy at the bottom of the cavity, although the focusing effect is stronger in the former geometry. Focusing and defocusing effects due to the strong topography of the Gaussian hill produce a strong amplification of displacements at a spot located on the flank opposite to the source. Backscattering from the top of the hill is also clearly seen.},

  abstract = {A specific model of the earthquake nucleation that proceeds on a non-uniform fault is put forward to explain seismological data on the nucleation in terms of the underlying physics. The model is compatible with Gutenberg-Richter’s similarity law for earthquake frequency-magnitude relation. A theoretical approach in the framework of fracture mechanics, based on a laboratory-based slip-dependent constitutive law, leads to the conclusion that the earthquake moment Mo scales with the third power of the critical slip displacement Dc and the critical size 2Lc (Lc, half-length) of the nucleation zone. This scaling relation quantitatively explains seismological data published, and it predicts that 2Lc is of the order of 10 km for earthquakes with Mo = 1021 Nm, 1 km for earthquakes with Mo = 1018 Nm, and 100 m for earthquakes with Mo = 1015 Nm, under the assumption that the breakdown stress drop D\textasciitilde b = 10 MPa. However, Lc depends on not only Dc but also D\textasciitilde b, so that the scaling relation between Lc and Dc may be violated by D\textasciitilde b, because D\textasciitilde b potentially takes any value in a wide range from 1 to 102 MPa, depending on the seismogenic environment. The good agreement between the theoretical relation and observed results suggests that a large earthquake may result from the failure of a large patch of high rupture growth resistance, whereas a small earthquake may result from the breakdown of a small patch of high rupture growth resistance. The present result encourages one to pursue the prediction capability for large earthquakes.},

  abstract = {We simulate 0- to 0.5-Hz 3D wave propagation through the Southern California Earthquake Center seismic velocity reference model, version 2, for the 1994 Northridge earthquake in order to examine the effects of anelastic attenuation and amplification within the near-surface sediments. We use a fourth-order finite-difference staggered-grid method with the coarse-grained frequency-independent anelastic scheme of Day and Bradley (2001) and a variable slip distribution from kinematic inversion for the Northridge earthquake. We find that the near-surface material with S-wave velocity (Vs) as low as 500 m/sec significantly affects the long-period peak ground velocities, compared with simulations in which the S-wave velocity is constrained to 1 km/sec and greater. Anelastic attenuation also has a strong effect on ground-motion amplitudes, reducing the predicted peak velocity by a factor of up to 2.5, relative to lossless simulations. Our preferred Q model is Qs/Vs = 0.02 (Vs in meters per second) for Vs less than 1–2 km/sec, and much larger Qs/Vs (0.1, Vs in meters per second) for layers with higher velocities. The simple model reduces the standard deviation of the residuals between synthetic and observed natural log of peak velocity from 1.13 to 0.26, relative to simulations for the lossless case. The anelastic losses have their largest effect on short-period surface waves propagating in the Los Angeles basin, which are principally sensitive to Qs in the low-velocity, near-surface sediments of the basin. The low-frequency ground motion simulated here is relatively insensitive to Qp, as well as to the values of Qs at depths greater than roughly that of the 2-km/sec S-wave velocity isosurface.},

  abstract = {It is well established that sedimentary basins can significantly amplify earthquake ground motion. However, the amplification at any given site can vary with earthquake location. To account for basin response in probabilistic seismic hazard analysis, therefore, we need to know the average amplification and intrinsic variability (standard deviation) at each site, given all earthquakes of concern in the region. Due to a dearth of empirical ground-motion observations, theoretical simulations constitute our best hope of addressing this issue. Here, 0–0.5 Hz finitedifference, finite-fault simulations are used to estimate the three-dimensional (3D) response of the Los Angeles basin to nine different earthquake scenarios. Amplification is quantified as the peak velocity obtained from the 3D simulation divided by that predicted using a regional one-dimensional (1D) crustal model. Average amplification factors are up to a factor of 4, with the values from individual scenarios typically differing by as much as a factor of 2.5. The average amplification correlates with basin depth, with values near unity at sites above sediments with thickness less than 2 km, and up to factors near 6 above the deepest (Ϸ 9 km) and steepest-dipping parts of the basin. There is also some indication that amplification factors are greater for events located farther from the basin edge. If the 3D amplification factors are divided by the 1D vertical SH-wave amplification below each site, they are lowered by up to a factor of 1.7. The duration of shaking in the 3D model is found to be longer, by up to more than 60 seconds, relative to the 1D basin response. The simulation of the 1994 Northridge earthquake reproduces recorded 0–0.5 Hz particle velocities relatively well, in particular at near-source stations. The synthetic and observed peak velocities agree within a factor of two and the log standard deviation of the residuals is 0.36. This is a reduction of 54\% and 51\% compared to the values obtained for the regional 1D model and a 1D model defined by the velocity and density profile below a site in the middle of the basin (DOW), respectively. This result suggests that long-period ground-motion estimation can be improved considerably by including the 3D basin structure. However, there are uncertainties concerning accuracy of the basin model, model resolution, the omission of material with shear velocities lower than 1 km/s, and the fact that only nine scenarios have been considered. Therefore, the amplification factors reported here should be used with caution until they can be further tested against observations. However, the results do serve as a guide to what should be expected, particularly with respect to increased amplification factors at sites located above the deeper parts of the basin.},

However, these CVMs usually poorly resolve near-surface small-scale amplification effects. Toward characterizing the variability of shallow sediment amplification, we have investigated the effects of inhomogeneities with fractal distributions augmented onto the shallow seismic velocity structure derived from the SCEC CVM V.4.0. Our analysis used linear 0-2 Hz 3D visco-elastic finitedifference wave propagation with grid spacings of 25 m or less. We find that even simple and rather weak fractal stochastic inhomogenities imply significant variations in ground motion amplifications (up to a factor of four), including bands of strong amplification aligned along the average ray path from a horizontally-propagating SH-wave source. We show that these patterns depend strongly on the incidence angle of the main wavefront. For vertically-incident planar SH-wave sources we find that the largest contribution to the site effects from small-scale heterogeneities arise from those included in the upper \textasciitilde 100 m of the sediment column. Finally, it is important to tune the statistical model (scattering Q) with anelastic attenuation (intrinsic Q), where a tradeoff appears to persist.},

  abstract = {In this study we apply a nonparametric spectral inversion scheme to a data set of accelerograms recorded by the K-NET and KiK-net networks in Japan in order to derive attenuation characteristics, source spectra, and site response. For this purpose, we use a total of more than 67,000 S-wave records from 2178 earthquakes (MJMA 2.7–8) obtained at 1555 stations at the Earth’s surface and more than 29,000 records from 1826 events recorded at 637 borehole stations at depths of 100 to 3000 m. Attenuation characteristics are investigated in five separate regions, showing that crustal Q depicts lower values in central compared to southern Japan, and a significant frequency dependence is observed in every region. The source spectra follow the ω2 model with higher stress drops for subcrustal earthquakes as compared with crustal ones. While strong amplification effects dominate the site contributions for the surface sensors, those for the borehole sensors are characterized by smaller variability. Nevertheless, consistent with observations from deconvolution of borehole/surface recording pairs, downgoing wave effects are visible in the site contributions for many borehole stations. Finally, the site amplification functions obtained at the surface are compared with surface-to-borehole (S/B) and horizontal-to-vertical (H/V) spectral ratios, showing that the S/B ratios generally provide better estimates of the horizontal amplification than the H/V ratios due to amplification of the vertical component of ground motion.},

Variations in the thicknesses of these layers control the hydrologic and biogeochemical responses of landscapes. Currently, Earth System Models approximate the thickness of these relatively permeable layers above bedrock as uniform globally, despite the fact that their thicknesses vary systematically with topography, climate, and geology. To meet the need for more realistic input data for models, we developed a high-resolution gridded global data set of the average thicknesses of soil, intact regolith, and sedimentary deposits within each 30 arcsec ( 1 km) pixel using the best available data for topography, climate, and geology as input. Our data set partitions the global land surface into upland hillslope, upland valley bottom, and lowland landscape components and uses models optimized for each landform type to estimate the thicknesses of each subsurface layer. On hillslopes, the data set is calibrated and validated using independent data sets of measured soil thicknesses from the U.S. and Europe and on lowlands using depth to bedrock observations from groundwater wells in the U.S. We anticipate that the data set will prove useful as an input to regional and global hydrological and ecosystems models.},

  abstract = {Waveform modelling is essential for seismic imaging and inversion. Because including more physical characteristics can potentially yield more accurate Earth models, we analyse strategies for elastic seismic wave propagation modelling including topography. We focus on using finite differences on modified staggered grids. Computational grids can be curved to fit the topography using distribution functions. With the chain rule, the elasto-dynamic formulation is adapted to be solved directly on curved staggered grids. The chain-rule approach is computationally less expensive than the tensorial approach for finite differences below the 6th order, but more expensive than the classical approach for flat topography (i.e. rectangular staggered grids). Free-surface conditions are evaluated and implemented according to the stress image method. Nonreflective boundary conditions are simulated via a Convolutional Perfect Matching Layer. This implementation does not generate spurious diffractions when the free-surface topography is not horizontal, as long as the topography is smoothly curved. Optimal results are obtained when the angle between grid lines at the free surface is orthogonal.},

  abstract = {Background: Writing plays a central role in the communication of scientific ideas and is therefore a key aspect in researcher education, ultimately determining the success and long-term sustainability of their careers. Despite the growing popularity of e-learning, we are not aware of any existing study comparing on-line vs. traditional classroom-based methods for teaching scientific writing. Methods: Forty eight participants from a medical, nursing and physiotherapy background from US and Brazil were randomly assigned to two groups (n = 24 per group): An on-line writing workshop group (on-line group), in which participants used virtual communication, google docs and standard writing templates, and a standard writing guidance training (standard group) where participants received standard instruction without the aid of virtual communication and writing templates. Two outcomes, manuscript quality was assessed using the scores obtained in Six subgroup analysis scale as the primary outcome measure, and satisfaction scores with Likert scale were evaluated. To control for observer variability, inter-observer reliability was assessed using Fleiss's kappa. A posthoc analysis comparing rates of communication between mentors and participants was performed. Nonparametric tests were used to assess intervention efficacy. Results: Excellent inter-observer reliability among three reviewers was found, with an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) agreement = 0.931882 and ICC consistency = 0.932485. On-line group had better overall manuscript quality (p = 0.0017, SSQSavg score 75.3 ± 14.21, ranging from 37 to 94) compared to the standard group (47.27 ± 14.64, ranging from 20 to 72). Participant satisfaction was higher in the on-line group (4.3 ± 0.73) compared to the standard group (3.09 ± 1.11) (p = 0.001). The standard group also had fewer communication events compared to the online group (0.91 ± 0.81 vs. 2.05 ± 1.23; p = 0.0219).

  abstract = {High-frequency seismograms mainly consist of incoherently scattered waves. Although their phases are more or less random, their envelopes show smooth and stable variations depending on frequency and distance. Envelope modeling can thus be used to infer stochastic parameters of the heterogeneous Earth medium. Radiative transfer theory (RTT) describes energy transport through a random heterogeneous medium neglecting phase information and has been frequently used to simulate observed mean square (MS) envelopes of high-frequency waves. The radiative transfer equations can be numerically solved by Monte Carlo simulations. So far, mostly isotropic scattering and acoustic approximations have been used. Here we present an extension of the Monte Carlo method to the full elastic case including P, S, and conversion scattering where the single scattering events are described by angular-dependent scattering coefficients in random media which follow from the Born approximation. In order to validate the method, the simulated envelopes are compared to average envelopes obtained by full waveform modeling with a finite difference method in two-dimensional random media with Gaussian and exponential correlation functions. Envelope shapes agree remarkably well for both short and long lapse times and for a broad range of scattering parameters. We conclude that the use of Born scattering coefficients in RTT does not pose severe limits on its validity range. Even in the strong forward scattering regime, envelope broadening and peak amplitude delays can be successfully modeled if one includes the wandering effect as obtained from the parabolic wave equation and Markov approximation into RTT.},

Seismic noise data in the period range 2 and 20 s recorded in year 2014 by 346 stations with 1- to 30-km station spacing are analyzed. Rayleigh and Love wave phase travel times are measured using vertical-vertical and transverse-transverse noise cross correlations, and group travel times are derived from the phase measurements. Using the Eikonal equation for each location and period, isotropic phase and group velocities and 2-psi azimuthal anisotropy are determined statistically with measurements from different virtual sources. Starting with the SCEC Community Velocity Model, the observed 2.5- to 16-s isotropic phase and group dispersion curves are jointly inverted on a 0.05° × 0.05° grid to obtain local 1-D piecewise shear wave velocity (Vs) models. Compared to the starting model, the final results have generally lower Vs in the shallow crust (top 3–10 km), particularly in areas such as basins and fault zones. The results also show clear velocity contrasts across the San Andreas, San Jacinto, Elsinore, and Garlock Faults and suggest that the San Andreas Fault southeast of San Gorgonio Pass is dipping to the northeast. Investigation of the nonuniqueness of the 1-D Vs inversion suggests that imaging the top 3-km Vs structure requires either shorter period (≤2 s) surface wave dispersion measurements or other types of data set such as Rayleigh wave ellipticity.},

We examine the relationship between the site residuals, which represent the average modeling error of the reference ground motion prediction equation at a station, and the three topographic parameters. Our analysis shows that there are statistically significant trends in site residuals with respect to relative elevation and smoothed curvature. We propose modification factors to the Chiou and Youngs (2014) model that account for topographic effects on both the median and the standard deviation. These factors are period dependent and are a function of the relative elevation at the site. The factors result in amplification on median by a factor as high as 1.13 at T = 0.5 s for higher values of relative elevation, and deamplification as low as 0.75 between T = 2 s to 3 s for lower values of relative elevations.},

  abstract = {Seismic site response analysis evaluates the influence of local soil conditions on earthquake ground shaking. There are multiple sources of potential uncertainty in this analysis; the most significant pertaining to the specification of the input motions and to the characterization of the soil properties. The influence of the selection of input ground motions on equivalent-linear site response analysis is evaluated through analyses performed with multiple suites of input motions selected to fit the same target acceleration response spectrum. The results indicate that a stable median surface response spectrum ͑i.e., within Ϯ20\% of any other suite͒ can be obtained with as few as five motions, if the motions fit the input target spectrum well. The stability of the median is improved to Ϯ5 to 10\% when 10 or 20 input motions are used. If the standard deviation of the surface response spectra is required, at least 10 motions ͑and preferably 20͒ are required to adequately model the standard deviation. The influence of soil characterization uncertainty is assessed through Monte Carlo simulations, where variations in the shear-wave velocity profile and nonlinear soil properties are considered. Modeling shear-wave velocity variability generally reduces the predicted median surface motions and amplification factors, most significantly at periods less than the site period. Modeling the variability in nonlinear properties has a similar, although slightly smaller, effect. Finally, including the variability in soil properties significantly increases the standard deviation of the amplification factors but has a lesser effect on the standard deviation of the surface motions.},

  abstract = {Centrifuge modeling is a valuable tool used to study the response of geotechnical structures to infrequent or extreme events such as earthquakes. A series of centrifuge model tests was conducted at 80g using an electro-hydraulic earthquake simulator mounted on the C-CORE geotechnical centrifuge to study the dynamic response of soft soils and seismic soil–structure interaction (SSI). The acceleration records at different locations within the soil bed and at its surface along with the settlement records at the surface were used to analyze the soft soil seismic response. In addition, the records of acceleration at the surface of a foundation model partially embedded in the soil were used to investigate the seismic SSI. Centrifuge data was used to evaluate the variation of shear modulus and damping ratio with shear strain amplitude and confining pressure, and to assess their effects on site response. Site response analysis using the measured shear wave velocity, estimated modulus reduction and damping ratio as input parameters produced good agreement with the measured site response. A spectral analysis of the results showed that the stiffness of the soil deposits had a significant effect on the characteristics of the input motions and the overall behavior of the structure. The peak surface acceleration measured in the centrifuge was significantly amplified, especially for low amplitude base acceleration. The amplification of the earthquake shaking as well as the frequency of the response spectra decreased with increasing earthquake intensity. The results clearly demonstrate that the layering system has to be considered, and not just the average shear wave velocity, when evaluating the local site effects.},

  abstract = {We performed fully deterministic broadband (0–4 Hz) high-performance computing ground motion simulations of a magnitude 7.0 scenario earthquake on the Hayward Fault (HF) in the San Francisco Bay Area of Northern California. Simulations consider average one-dimensional (1-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) anelastic structure with flat and topographic free surfaces. Ground motion intensity measures (GMIMs) for the 3-D model display dramatic differences across the HF due to geologic heterogeneity, with low wave speeds east of the HF amplifying motions. The median GMIMs agree well with Ground Motion Prediction Equations (GMPEs); however, the 3-D model generates more scatter than the 1-D model. Ratios of 3-D/1-D GMIMs from the same source allow isolation of path and site effects for the 3-D model. These ratios show remarkably similar trends as site-specific factors for the GMPE predictions, suggesting that wave propagation effects in our 3-D simulations are on average consistent with empirical data. Plain Language Summary With the use of powerful supercomputers and an efficient numerical method, modeling of ground shaking for a magnitude 7.0 earthquake on the Hayward Fault results in more realistic motions than previously achieved. The model includes the current best representation of the Earth (geology and surface topography) to compute seismic wave ground shaking throughout the region. Shaking intensity shows differences across the Hayward Fault that arise from rocks of different geologic origin. On average, results are consistent with models based on actual recorded earthquake motions from around the world. This study shows that powerful supercomputing can be used to calculate earthquake shaking with more realism than previously obtained.},

The predictions are based on lowfrequency (LF, 0–1 Hz) finite-difference (FD) simulations for six different rupture models generated during a previous study (Roten et al., 2011), which we combine with high-frequency (HF, 1–10 Hz) shear-to-shear (S-to-S) back-scattering operators to generate BB synthetics. Average horizontal spectral accelerations at 5 and 10 Hz (0.2-s SAs and 0.1-s SAs, respectively) calculated from the linear BB synthetics exceed estimates from four recent ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) at near-fault ({$<$} 5 km) locations on the sediment by more than one standard deviation, but agree with the GMPEs at larger rupture distances. The overprediction of the near-fault GMPE values is largely eliminated after corrections of the BB synthetics for nonlinear soil effects are applied, reducing the SAs from the simulations by up to 70\%. These corrections are based on amplitude-, frequency-, and site-dependent correction functions from 1D nonlinear simulations at ∼450 locations in the Salt Lake basin, using a simple soil model based in part on published laboratory experiments on Bonneville clay samples. We obtain geometric mean 1-s SAs from from the six scenarios of more than 0.75g on the hanging-wall side of the fault. Geometric mean 0.2-s SAs exceed 1g on the hanging-wall and on the footwall sediments in the central Salt Lake basin, and peak horizontal ground accelerations range from 0.45 to {$>$} 0:60g in the same general locations.},

  abstract = {Computer simulations of large (M ≥ 7.8) earthquakes rupturing the southern San Andreas Fault from SE to NW (e.g., ShakeOut, widely used for earthquake drills) have predicted strong long-period ground motions in the densely populated Los Angeles Basin due to channeling of waves through a series of interconnected sedimentary basins. Recently, the importance of this waveguide amplification effect for seismic shaking in the Los Angeles Basin has also been confirmed from observations of the ambient seismic field. By simulating the ShakeOut earthquake scenario (based on a kinematic source description) for a medium governed by Drucker-Prager plasticity, we show that nonlinear material behavior could reduce the earlier predictions of large long-period ground motions in the Los Angeles Basin by up to 70\% as compared to viscoelastic solutions. These reductions are primarily due to yielding near the fault, although yielding may also occur in the shallow low-velocity deposits of the Los Angeles Basin if cohesions are close to zero. Fault zone plasticity remains important even for conservative values of cohesions, suggesting that current simulations assuming a linear response of rocks are overpredicting ground motions during future large earthquakes on the southern San Andreas Fault.},

  abstract = {Numerical models of earthquake ground motions are able to capture multi-dimensional wave propagation phenomena at multiple scale lengths, and help to understand surface ground motions as the coupled nonlinear response of source, path and site effects. High-performance computing applications like the AWP-ODC finite difference code, which employs 1000's of GPUs on modern supercomputers to accelerate calculations, have resulted in a significant increase in the resolution of such large-scale 3D wave propagation simulations. The code accounts for plastic yielding using a Drucker-Prager yield condition, and has been used to simulate nonlinear effects in both the fault damage zone and shallow crust. For example, a fully nonlinear simulation of a M 7.7 earthquake on the southern San Andreas fault was recently performed for a maximum frequency of 4 Hz using AWP. Dynamic rupture simulations with inelastic deformation in the fault zone, also performed using AWP, were able to reproduce surface deformation patterns observed after the 1992 M 7.3 Landers earthquake. Unfortunately, the high computational cost still limits such physics-based ground motion prediction to frequencies in the lower band of the spectrum relevant for buildings (0 – 10 Hz). In order to resolve the wavefield across the full spectrum relevant for engineering while keeping computational requirements within reach we have implemented a discontinuous mesh (DM) in AWP-ODC. We test the DM method by simulating the Mw 5.1 La Habra earthquake for frequencies up to 4 Hz, using a grid spacing of 20 m in the fine grid and a minimum shearwave velocity of 500 m/s. Synthetics obtained with the DM are accurately reproducing reference solutions computed using a uniform mesh in the time and frequency domain.},

  abstract = {We estimate ground motions in the Pacific Northwest urban areas during M9 subduction scenario earthquakes on the Cascadia megathrust by simulating wave propagation from an ensemble of kinematic source descriptions. Velocities and densities in our computational mesh are defined by integrating the regional Cascadia Community Velocity Model (CVM) v1.6 (Stephenson et al. P-and S-wave velocity models incorporating the Cascadia subduction zone for 3D earthquake ground motion simulations—update for open-file report 2007–1348, US Geological Survey, 2017) including the ocean water layer with a local velocity model of the Georgia basin (Molnar, Predicting earthquake ground shaking due to 1D soil layering and 3D basin structure in SW British Columbia, Canada, 2011), including additional near-surface velocity information. We generate six source realizations, each consisting of a background slip distribution with correlation lengths, rise times and rupture velocities consistent with data from previous megathrust earthquakes (e.g., 2011 M 9 Tohoku or 2010 M 8.8 Maule). We then superimpose M * 8 subevents, characterized by short rise times and high stress drops on the background slip model to mimic high-frequency strong ground motion generation areas in the deeper portion of the rupture (Frankel, Bull Seismol Soc Am 107(1):372–386, 2017). The wave propagation is simulated using the discontinuous mesh (DM) version of the AWP finite difference code. We simulate frequencies up to 1.25 Hz, using a spatial discretization of 100 m in the fine grid, resulting in surface grid dimensions of 6540 9 10,728 mesh points. At depths below 8 km, the grid step increases to 300 m. We obtain stable and accurate results for the DM method throughout the simulation time of 7.5 min as verified against a solution obtained with a uniform 100 m grid spacing. Peak ground velocities (PGVs) range between 0.57 and 1.0 m/s in downtown Seattle and between 0.25 and 0.54 m/s in downtown Vancouver, while spectral accelerations at 2 s range between 1.7 and 3.6 m/s2 and 1.0 and 1.3 m/ s2, respectively. These long-period ground motions are not significantly reduced if plastic Drucker-Prager yielding in shallow cohesionless sediments is taken into account. Effects of rupture directivity are significant at periods of * 10 s, but almost absent at shorter periods. We find that increasing the depth extent of the subducting slab from the truncation at 60 km in the Cascadia CVM version 1.6 to * 100 km increases the PGVs by 15\% in Seattle and by 40\% in Vancouver.},

If a equals b, the attenuation of the transmitted wave can be successfully explained by single scattering theory. the attenuation maximum occurs at kb≈ 1–2, where k is the wavenumber. For media with a \&gt; b we observe a stronger attenuation than expected from single scattering theory for kb greater than 6. the attenuation peak is shifted to smaller kb values when the spatial anisotropy of the random fluctuations is increased. the investigation of the seismic coda shows that the single scattering theory cannot explain the time dependence of the coda. Coda Q, as determined from the coda decay rate under the single scattering assumption, does not describe the scattering attenuation. In 1-D random media the decay rate of the coda observed in transmission decreases with increasing standard deviation of the impedance fluctuations. In the 2-D case the decay rate increases slightly with the standard deviation.},

  abstract = {High-frequency S wave seismogram envelopes are broadened with increasing travel distance due to diffraction and scattering. The basic mechanism of the broadening has been studied on the basis of the scattering theory with the parabolic approximation for the scalar wave equation in random media. However, conventional models are not realistic enough since the plane wave modeling is too simple and the Gaussian autocorrelation function (ACF) is far from the reality to represent the inhomogeneity in the Earth. Focusing on the early part of envelopes, we formulated the envelope broadening of spherically outgoing scalar waves in three-dimensional von Kármán-type random media, of which the spectra decay according to a power law at large wave numbers. Random media are characterized by three parameters: RMS fractional velocity fluctuation ε, correlation distance a, and order κ that controls the gradient of the power law spectra. This model predicts that the envelope duration increases with both travel distance and frequency when short-wavelength components are rich in random media, while the duration is independent of frequency when short-wavelength components are poor. Introducing phenomenological attenuation Q, we developed a method for estimating the parameters of inhomogeneity and attenuation from the envelope duration. Applying this method to S wave seismogram envelopes for the frequency range from 2 to 32 Hz in northeastern Honshu Japan, we estimated the random inhomogeneity parameters as κ = 0.6, ε2.2a−1 ≈ 10−3.6 [km−1] and f/Q = 0.0095 [s−1], where f is frequency. The power law portion of the estimated power spectral density function is P(m) ≈ 0.01 m−4.2 [km3], where m is wave number.},

Despite their importance, there is little guidance on the best way to map riparian zones for broad spatial extents (e.g., large watersheds) when detailed maps from field data or high-resolution imagery and terrain data are not available. Using well-established accuracy metrics (e.g., kappa, precision, computational complexity), we evaluated eight methods commonly used to map riparian zones. Focusing on a semi-arid, mountainous watershed, we found that the most accurate and robust method for mapping riparian zones combines data on upstream drainage area and valley topography. That method performed best regardless of stream order, and was most effective when implemented with fine resolution topographic and stream line data. Other commonly used methods to model riparian zones, such as those based on fixed-width buffers, yielded inaccurate results. We recommend that until very-high resolution ({$<$}1 m) elevation data are available at broad extents, models of riparian zones for semi-arid mountainous regions should incorporate drainage area, valley topography, and quantify uncertainty.},

Introduction of boundary conditions leads to a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind for boundary sources. A discretization scheme based on the numerical and analytical integration of exact Green's functions for displacements and tractions is employed. Calculations are performed in the frequency domain and synthetic seismograms are obtained using the fast Fourier transform.In order to give perspective on the range of effects caused by topographic anomalies, various examples that cover extreme cases are presented. It is found that topography may cause significant effects both of amplification and of deamplification at the irregular feature itself and its neighborhood, but the absolute level of amplification is generally lower than about four times the amplitude of incoming waves. Such facts must be taken into account when the spectral ratio technique is used to characterize topographical effects.},

  abstract = {Analyzing horizontal component seismograms of small earthquakes with intermediate hypocentral distances in southeastern Honshu, Japan, we found that time widths of seismogram envelopes around direct S waves are much longer than source duration times estimated from their magnitudes. The time lags of the maximum amplitude and the half maximum after the peak were measured from the onset of the direct S wave arrival from band-pass-filtered seismograms from 2 to 32 Hz. Even though there is considerable scatter, both the time lags are found to increase with increasing hypocentral distance up to 305 km. We hypothesize that pulse shape broadens and the maximum amplitude is reduced after propagating through the random structure of the lithosphere. The parabolic approximation theoretically predicts that the long-wavelength component of velocity inhomogeneities compared with the wavelength of seismic waves produces diffraction fluctuations and makes seismogram envelopes broaden with increasing travel distance in the saturated regime. Supposing a Gaussian autocorrelation function for the randomness and an empirical frequency dependent attenuation, we propose a formula for the temporal change in the power spectral density of seismic waves. Applying this formula to the observed data, we statistically evaluated the scale of random inhomogeneities: the mean square fractional velocity fluctuation was estimated to be 10−3 times the correlation distance a in kilometers.},

  abstract = {We simulate 0–2.5 Hz deterministic wave propagation in 3-D velocity models for the 2008 Chino Hills, CA, earthquake using a finite-fault source model and frequency-dependent anelastic attenuation. Small-scale heterogeneities are modeled as 3-D random fields defined using an elliptically anisotropic von Ka´rma´n autocorrelation function with its parameters constrained using Los Angeles basin borehole data. We superimpose the heterogeneity models on a leading deterministic community velocity model (CVM) of southern California. We find that models of velocity and density perturbations can have significant effects on the wavefield at frequencies as low as 0.5 Hz, with ensemble median values of various ground motion metrics varying up to ±50 per cent compared to those computed using the deterministic CVM only. In addition, we show that frequency-independent values of the shear-wave quality factor (Qs0) parametrized as Qs0 = 150Vs (Vs in km s–1) provides the best agreement with data when assuming the published moment magnitude (Mw) of 5.4 (M0 = 1.6 × 1017 Nm) for the finite-fault source model. This model for Qs0 trades off with Qs0 = 100Vs assuming Mw = 5.5 (M0 = 2.2 × 1017 Nm), which represents an upper bound of the Mw estimates for this event. We find the addition of small-scale heterogeneities provides limited overall improvement to the misfit between simulations and data for the considered ground motion metrics, because the primary sources of misfit originate from the deterministic CVM and/or the finite-fault source description.},

  abstract = {High-frequency seismic ground motion (10+ Hz), as needed for earthquake engineering design purposes, is largely controlled by the metre-scale structure of the earth’s crust. However, the state-of-the-art velocity models poorly resolve small-scale features of the subsurface velocity and density variation. We invert 35 sonic logs (up to 3000 m in depth) in and near Los Angeles basin, CA, to obtain a statistical description of the small-scale heterogeneities of the basin. Assuming a von Karman autocorrelation function, our analysis finds that Hurst numbers, ν, between 0.0 and 0.2, vertical correlation lengths, az, of 15–150 m and standard deviations of about 5 per cent characterize the variability in the borehole data. We report average parameters for Los Angeles basin of ν = 0.064 (0.058, 0.069) ± 0.01 (0.006, 0.012) and az = 54 (51.1, 57.6) ± 5.9 (1.79, 9.53) m with 95 per cent confidence intervals listed in the parentheses. Despite the large depth range of the logs, there is no significant variation of the statistical parameters with depth. Our analysis of 371 depth-averaged shear wave velocities in the upper 30 m, Vs30, provides only an upper bound of basin scale-length estimates due to the coarse sampling distance, with a Hurst number of about 0.3 and lateral correlation lengths, ax, of 5–10 km.},

  abstract = {Even though high-frequency seismograms of local earthquakes are complex because of the excitation of scattered waves caused by random lithospheric heterogeneities, their envelopes are well reproduced by the forward scattering approximation on the basis of stochastic characterization of random media. We present a method to synthesize three-component vector wave envelopes for a point shear dislocation source by way of the stochastic raypath method using the Markov approximation for the parabolic wave equation. Because of multiple forward scattering, the directionality of the synthesized envelope shows a smoothed quadrant pattern compared to the original radiation pattern; the scattered or diffracted energy appears even in the direction of the null axis and on the nodal planes. The quadrant pattern becomes smooth as hypocentral distance increases. To examine the availability of the synthesized envelope, we analyze seismograms of two small strike-slip earthquakes that occurred in southwestern Japan. First, we estimate the statistical parameters characterizing the randomness and the intrinsic absorptions in frequencies 2–4, 4–8, and 8–16 Hz assuming a von Karman-type random medium, and then we examine the directionality of the envelope. The maximum energy density of the envelope shows a quadrant pattern for both P and S waves with a 45 degree shift. The directionality appears in the frequencies up to 16 Hz and at distances up to 200 km. The directionality also appears on the S wave envelope duration. The observed directionality is well explained by the synthesized envelope, but it is still difficult to explain the partition of energy into three components by the synthesized envelopes.},

  abstract = {Based on the results obtained by analysing a large number of dynamic strike slip and dipping fault ruptures we construct a kinematic rupture model generator that incorporates some of the key source parameters extracted from the dynamic rupture models. In this kinematic rupture model, the slip rate function includes the final slip, the rise time, the local rupture velocity and the peak time (a measure of the impulsive part of the slip rate function). A four-dimensional correlation matrix is used to describe the spatial interdependency between the four source parameters—each of which is modelled as correlated random field. Each source parameter has a different marginal distribution determined from the analysis of the dynamic models. The marginal distributions are allowed to change as a function of distance from the hypocentre. The autocorrelation of each parameter is modelled by a power spectrum that follows a power law. The value of the spectral decay of the power law for the different source parameters is based on the results obtained from the dynamic rupture models. Finally, the values of rise time and peak time are adjusted such that the moment rate function fits a Brune spectrum for a specified corner frequency. We validate the rupture model generator using observed strong motion near field recording for the 1994 Northridge earthquake and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. We perform comparisons with the rupture model generator of Liu et al. We find that only considering the response spectral bias of a best model is not sufficient to validate a rupture model generator. Thus we test the predictive power of the two rupture model generators if multiple ruptures are computed. Overall, the new rupture model generator yields a better prediction, compared to Liu et al., for the two validation events, especially in predicting observed PGV values and pseudospectral velocity at low frequencies ({$<$}1 Hz).},

  abstract = {To analyze seismic wave propagation in geological structures, it is possible to consider various numerical approaches: the finite difference method, the spectral element method, the boundary element method, the finite element method, the finite volume method, etc. All these methods have various advantages and drawbacks. The amplification of seismic waves in surface soil layers is mainly due to the velocity contrast between these layers and, possibly, to topographic effects around crests and hills. The influence of the geometry of alluvial basins on the amplification process is also know to be large. Nevertheless, strong heterogeneities and complex geometries are not easy to take into account with all numerical methods. 2D/3D models are needed in many situations and the efficiency/accuracy of the numerical methods in such cases is in question. Furthermore, the radiation conditions at infinity are not easy to handle with finite differences or finite/spectral elements whereas it is explicitely accounted in the Boundary Element Method. Various absorbing layer methods (e.g. FPML, M-PML) were recently proposed to attenuate the spurious wave reflections especially in some difficult cases such as shallow numerical models or grazing incidences. Finally, strong earthquakes involve nonlinear effects in surficial soil layers. To model strong ground motion, it is thus necessary to consider the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of soils and simultaneously investigate seismic wave propagation in complex 2D/3D geological structures! Recent advances in numerical formulations and constitutive models in such complex situations are presented and discussed in this paper. A crucial issue is the availability of the field/laboratory data to feed and validate such models.},

In this work a spectral element method in conjunction with a new iterative solution technique is presented. The very high spatial accuracy of the algorithm allows for increased computational efficiency when compared to standard finite element method. In addition, the use of an iterative solver, based on a local element-by-element formulation and a matrix-vector product which is factored and converted to a faster matrix-matrix product, allows for a significant reduction both in storage requirements and in the computational complexity. The resulting algorithm can easily be implemented on high-performance vector and/or parallel processors. The numerical scheme has been tested on a Cray T3E supercomputer. Our experimental results show that efficiency is very high and that good load balancing can be obtained at run time, because relevant blocks of computations are performed at the element level and are totally independent.},

  abstract = {A fast marching level set method is presented for monotonically advancing fronts, which leads to an extremely fast scheme for solving the Eikonal equation. Level set methods are numerical techniques for computing the position of propagating fronts. They rely on an initial value partial differential equation for a propagating level set function and use techniques borrowed from hyperbolic conservation laws. Topological changes, corner and cusp development, and accurate determination of geometric properties such as curvature and normal direction are naturally obtained in this setting. This paper describes a particular case of such methods for interfaces whose speed depends only on local position. The technique works by coupling work on entropy conditions for interface motion, the theory of viscosity solutions for Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and fast adaptive narrow band level set methods. The technique is applicable to a variety of problems, including shape-from-shading problems, lithographic development calculations in microchip manufacturing, and arrival time problems in control theory.},

  abstract = {Estimates of seismic wave attenuation are strongly affected by scattering. Scattering is an important effect caused by interaction of seismic wavefields with inhomogeneities of hydrocarbon reservoirs, Earth's crust and mantle. In order to study the contribution of scattering to apparent attenuation we consider plane-wave propagation in acoustic 2-D and 3-D inhomogeneous media. Different attenuation estimates result depending on what wavefield function is being averaged during corresponding processing. By wave-theoretical analysis and high-order finite difference modelling in two dimensions we show that scattering attenuation estimates derived from the mean of amplitude spectra and from the mean logarithm of amplitude spectra depend on travel distance. For not too long travel distances, where the coherent part of the wavefield dominates, we give an analytical description of these estimates. In 2-D and 3-D the relations are established between the autocorrelation functions of velocity fluctuations of a random medium and the autocorrelation functions of amplitude and phase fluctuations on a receiver line perpendicular to the general propagation direction of an originally plane wave. For long distances, where the wavefield fluctuates strongly, we show that both mean logarithm of amplitude and logarithm of mean amplitude tend to constants. They differ approximately by a factor two in both scattering regimes. The scattering attenuation coefficient of the meanfield is not dependent on travel distance. We compared our theoretical results with numerical calculations and found excellent agreements. The concept presented clarifies the nature of seismic Q estimations in the presence of scattering and can help to yield statistical earth models from seismic data.},

  abstract = {We present a new, 3D description of crust and upper mantle velocity structure in southern California implemented as a Unified Structural Representation (USR). The USR is comprised of detailed basin velocity descriptions that are based on tens of thousands of direct velocity (Vp, Vs) measurements and incorporates the locations and displacement of major fault zones that influence basin structure. These basin descriptions were used to developed tomographic models of crust and upper mantle velocity and density structure, which were subsequently iterated and improved using 3D waveform adjoint tomography. A geotechnical layer (GTL) based on Vs30 measurements and consistent with the underlying velocity descriptions was also developed as an optional model component. The resulting model provides a detailed description of the structure of the southern California crust and upper mantle that reflects the complex tectonic history of the region. The crust thickens eastward as Moho depth varies from 10 to 40 km reflecting the transition from oceanic to continental crust. Deep sedimentary basins and underlying areas of thin crust reflect Neogene extensional tectonics overprinted by transpressional deformation and rapid sediment deposition since the late Pliocene. To illustrate the impact of this complex structure on strong ground motion forecasting, we simulate rupture of a proposed M 7.9 earthquake source in the Western Transverse Ranges. The results show distinct basin amplification and focusing of energy that reflects crustal structure described by the USR that is not captured by simpler velocity descriptions. We anticipate that the USR will be useful for a broad range of simulation and modeling efforts, including strong ground motion forecasting, dynamic rupture simulations, and fault system modeling. The USR is available through the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) website (http://www.scec.org).},

Using such a model, we present a series of examples which demonstrate the effects of the free-surface, near-surface velocity gradients, and low impedance surface layers on the amplitudes of upcoming body waves. In some cases, these amplitudes are predictable from simple free-surface and impedance contrast expressions. However, in other cases these expressions are an unreliable guide to the complete response, and the full plane wave calculation must be performed. Large surface amplifications are possible, even without focusing due to lateral heterogeneities or nonlinear effects. Both surface and borehole seismometer site responses are almost always frequency-dependent.Ocean bottom versus borehole seismic data from the 1983 Ngendei Seismic Experiment in the southwest Pacific are consistent with both a simple plane wave model and a more complete synthetic seismogram calculation. The borehole seismic response to upcoming P waves is reduced at high frequencies because of interference between the upgoing P wave and downgoing P and SV waves reflected from the sediment-basement interface. However, because of much lower borehole noise levels, the borehole seismometer enjoys a P-wave signal-to-noise advantage of 3 to 7 dB over nearby ocean bottom instruments.},

  abstract = {We use interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and Global Positioning System (GPS) observations to investigate static deformation due to the 1999 Mw 7.1 Hector Mine earthquake, that occurred in the eastern California shear zone. Interferometric decorrelation, phase, and azimuth offset measurements indicate regions of surface and near-surface slip, which we use to constrain the geometry of surface rupture. The inferred geometry is spatially complex, with multiple strands. The southern third of the rupture zone consists of three subparallel segments extending about 20 km in length in a N45ЊW direction. The central segment is the simplest, with a single strand crossing the Bullion Mountains and a strike of N10ЊW. The northern third of the rupture zone is characterized by multiple splays, with directions subparallel to strikes in the southern and central. The average strike for the entire rupture is about N30ЊW. The interferograms indicate significant alongstrike variations in strain which are consistent with variations in the ground-based slip measurements. Using a variable resolution data sampling routine to reduce the computational burden, we invert the InSAR and GPS data for the fault geometry and distribution of slip. We compare results from assuming an elastic half-space and a layered elastic space. Results from these two elastic models are similar, although the layered-space model predicts more slip at depth than does the half-space model. The layered model predicts a maximum coseismic slip of more than 5 m at a depth of 3 to 6 km. Contrary to preliminary reports, the northern part of the Hector Mine rupture accommodates the maximum slip. Our model predictions for the surface fault offset and total seismic moment agree with both field mapping results and recent seismic models. The inferred shallow slip deficit is enigmatic and may suggest that distributed inelastic yielding occurred in the uppermost few kilometers of the crust during or soon after the earthquake.},

  abstract = {Ground motion prediction is an essential element in seismic hazard and risk analysis. Empirical ground motion prediction approaches have been widely used in the community, but efficient simulation-based ground motion prediction methods are needed to complement empirical approaches, especially in the regions with limited data constraints. Recently, dynamic rupture modelling has been successfully adopted in physics-based source and ground motion modelling, but it is still computationally demanding and many input parameters are not well constrained by observational data. Pseudo-dynamic source modelling keeps the form of kinematic modelling with its computational efficiency, but also tries to emulate the physics of source process. In this paper, we develop a statistical framework that governs the finite-fault rupture process with 1-point and 2-point statistics of source parameters in order to quantify the variability of finite source models for future scenario events. We test this method by extracting 1-point and 2-point statistics from dynamically derived source models and simulating a number of rupture scenarios, given target 1-point and 2-point statistics. We propose a new rupture model generator for stochastic source modelling with the covariance matrix constructed from target 2-point statistics, that is, auto- and cross-correlations. Our sensitivity analysis of nearsource ground motions to 1-point and 2-point statistics of source parameters provides insights into relations between statistical rupture properties and ground motions. We observe that larger standard deviation and stronger correlation produce stronger peak ground motions in general. The proposed new source modelling approach will contribute to understanding the effect of earthquake source on near-source ground motion characteristics in a more quantitative and systematic way.},

  abstract = {The Northridge earthquake caused 1.78 g acceleration in the east-west direction at a site in Tarzana, California, located about 6 km south of the mainshock epicenter. The accelerograph was located atop a hill about 15-m high, 500-m long, and 130-m wide, striking about N78°E. During the aftershock sequence, a temporary array of 21 three-component geophones was deployed in six radial lines centered on the accelerograph, with an average sensor spacing of 35 m. Station C00 was located about 2 m from the accelerograph. We inverted aftershock spectra to obtain average relative site response at each station as a function of direction of ground motion. We identified a 3.2-Hz resonance that is a transverse oscillation of the hill (a directional topographic effect). The top/base amplification ratio at 3.2 Hz is about 4.5 for horizontal ground motions oriented approximately perpendicular to the long axis of the hill and about 2 for motions parallel to the hill. This resonance is seen most strongly within 50 m of C00. Other resonant frequencies were also observed. A strong lateral variation in attenuation, probably associated with a fault, caused substantially lower motion at frequencies above 6 Hz at the east end of the hill. There may be some additional scattered waves associated with the fault zone and seen at both the base and top of the hill, causing particle motions (not spectral ratios) at the top of the hill to be rotated about 20° away from the direction transverse to the hill. The resonant frequency, but not the amplitude, of our observed topographic resonance agrees well with theory, even for such a low hill. Comparisons of our observations with theoretical results indicate that the 3D shape of the hill and its internal structure are important factors affecting its response. The strong transverse resonance of the hill does not account for the large east-west mainshock motions. Assuming linear soil response, mainshock east-west motions at the Tarzana accelerograph were amplified by a factor of about 2 or less compared with sites at the base of the hill. Probable variations in surficial shear-wave velocity do not account for the observed differences among mainshock acceleration observed at Tarzana and at two different sites within 2 km of Tarzana.},

In addition, hundreds of smaller earthquakes are recorded each month that provide the control data representing the linear behavior of the site. With the larger motions, we begin to see pore pressure build up on the liquefaction array at both the NEES Garner Valley Array site and at the NEES Wildlife Liquefaction Array site. We present the results of simulated pore pressure generation using the observed ground motions and a nonlinear anelastic hysteretic finite difference model of the soil response. We are able to reproduce this onset of pore pressure generation that occurs under the moderate strain levels associated with these ground motions. Additional work to be completed for this conference includes the development of an empirical model to predict pore pressure generation based on observed ground motions within a saturated soil column using data from the GVDA and WLA field sites. Correlations between pore pressure data and various ground motion parameters derived from accelerometers within the vertical arrays will be shown. Continuing studies on these unique data sets are improving our understanding of the physical process that drives liquefaction.},

  abstract = {Ten Kinemetrics model SSA-2 Solid State Accelerographs were deployed in two dense arrays following the Landers-Big Bear earthquake sequence. The two arrays were separated by approximately three km, the first at a shallow alluvial soil site and the second at a rock site. We examine the soil and rock sites in terms of spectral ratio and cross-spectrum estimates of the site response. In order to construct an accurate representation of the motion in the horizontal plane, we treat the two horizontal components simultaneously as a complex signal. The Fourier transform of this complex signal represents the true motion in the horizontal plane as expressed in the frequency domain. The spectral ratio estimate is the ratio of this Fourier transform at the soil sites to the rock sites. The cross-spectrum estimate is the ratio of the cross-spectral density between the soil and rock sites to the power spectral density of the rock site. Spectral ratio estimates of site amplification are consistently higher than cross-spectrum estimates. On average the soil sites show amplification factors on the order of 2 to 4 relative to the rock sites between the frequencies of 4 to 15 Hz. There are, however, large variations in the ground motion recorded at sites with separations as small as 80 m. These variations demonstrate that site response studies can be biased by the choice of location of the sensor at distances of 80 m. We conclude that in the analysis of site-specific amplification both cross-spectrum and spectral ratio techniques should be used along with ensemble averages over many events.},

  abstract = {Many  methods for estimating site response compare ground motions at sites of interest to a nearby rock site that is considered a “reference” motion. The critical assumption in these methods is that the surface-rock-site record (reference) is equivalent to the input motion at the base of the soil layers. Data collected in this study show that surface-rock sites can have a site response of their own, which could lead to an underestimation of the seismic hazard when these sites are used as reference sites. Data were collected from local and regional earthquakes on digital recorders, both at the surface and in boreholes, at two rock sites and one basin site in the San Jacinto mountains, southern California. The two rock sites, Keenwild and Piñon Flat, are located on granitic bedrock of the southern California peninsular ranges batholith. The basin site, Garner Valley, is an ancestral lake bed with watersaturated sediments, on top of a section of decomposed granite, which overlies the competent bedrock. Ground motion is recorded simultaneously at the surface and in the bedrock at all three sites. When the surface-rock sites are used as the reference site, i.e., the surface-rock motion is used as the input to the basin, the computed amplification underestimates the actual amplification at the basin site for frequencies above 2 to 5 Hz. This underestimation, by a factor of 2 to 4 depending on frequency and site, results from the rock sites having a site response of their own above the 2-to 5-Hz frequencies. The near-surface weathering and cracking of the bedrock affects the recorded ground motions at frequencies of engineering interest, even at sites that appear to be located on competent crystalline rock. The bedrock borehole ground motion can be used as the reference motion, but the effect of the downgoing wave field and the resulting destructive interference must be considered. This destructive interference may produce pseudo-resonances in the spectral amplification estimates. If one is careful, the bedrock borehole ground motion can be considered a good reference site for seismic hazard analysis even at distances as large as 20 km from the soil site.},

Small cuts with the background mesh are stabilized by adding penalty terms to the weak formulation. This ensures that the condition numbers of the mass and stiffness matrix are independent of how the boundary cuts the mesh. The penalties consist of jumps in higher order derivatives integrated over the interior faces of the elements cut by the boundary. The dependence on the polynomial degree of the condition number of the stabilized mass matrix is estimated. We conclude that the condition number grows extremely fast when increasing the polynomial degree of the finite element space. The time step restriction of the resulting system is investigated numerically and is concluded not to be worse than for a standard (non-immersed) finite element method.},

As an "open" system, groundwater may exchange mass and energy with its neighboring systems (soil, air, and surface water) through adsorption, ion-exchange, infiltration, evaporation, inflow, outflow, and other exchange forms. Consequently, both the quantity and quality of groundwater may vary with environmental changes and human activities. Due to population growth, and industrial and agricultural development, more and more groundwater is extracted, especially in arid areas. If the groundwater management problem is not seriously considered, over extraction may lead to groundwater mining, salt water intrusion, and land subsidence. In fact, the quality of groundwater is gradually deteriorating throughout the world. The problem of groundwater pollution has appeared, not only in developed countries, but also in developing countries. Ground water pollution is a serious environmental problem that may damage human health, destroy the ecosystem, and cause water shortage.},

  abstract = {Significant effort has been devoted over the last two decades to the development of various seismic velocity models for the region of southern California, United States. These models are mostly used in forward wave propagation simulation studies, but also as base models for tomographic and source inversions. Two of these models, the community velocity models CVM-S and CVM-H, are among the most commonly used for this region. This includes two alternative variations to the original models, the recently released CVM-S4.26 which incorporates results from a sequence of tomographic inversions into CVM-S, and the user-controlled option of CVM-H to replace the near-surface profiles with a VS30-based geotechnical model. Although either one of these models is regarded as acceptable by the modeling community, it is known that they have differences in their representation of the crustal structure and sedimentary deposits in the region, and thus can lead to different results in forward and inverse problems. In this paper, we evaluate the accuracy of these models when used to predict the ground motion in the greater Los Angeles region by means of an assessment of a collection of simulations of recent events. In total, we consider 30 moderate-magnitude earthquakes (3.5 {$<$} Mw {$<$} 5.5) between 1998 and 2014, and compare synthetics with data recorded by seismic networks during these events. The simulations are done using a finite-element parallel code, with numerical models that satisfy a maximum frequency of 1 Hz and a minimum shear wave velocity of 200 m s−1. The comparisons between data and synthetics are ranked quantitatively by means of a goodness-of-fit (GOF) criteria. We analyse the regional distribution of the GOF results for all events and all models, and draw conclusions from the results and how these correlate to the models. We find that, in light of our comparisons, the model CVM-S4.26 consistently yields better results.},

  abstract = {For practical modelling of high-frequency (\&gt;1~Hz) seismic wave propagation, we analysed the apparent radiation patterns and attenuations of P and S waves using observed Hi-net velocity seismograms for small-to-moderate crustal earthquakes in the Chugoku region, southwestern Japan. By comparing observed and simulated seismograms, we estimated practical parameter sets of crustal small-scale velocity heterogeneity and intrinsic attenuations of P and S waves (QP.int−1 and QS.int−1). Numerical simulations of seismic wave propagation were conducted via the finite-difference method using a 1-D crustal velocity structure model with additional 3-D small-scale velocity heterogeneity and intrinsic attenuation. The estimated crustal small-scale velocity heterogeneity is stochastically characterized by an exponential-type power spectral density function with correlation length of 1~km and root-mean-square value of 0.03. Estimated QP.int−1 and QS.int−1 values range from 10−2.6 to 10−2.0 and 10−2.8 to 10−2.4, respectively, indicating QP.int−1 \&gt; QS.int−1 for high frequencies (\&gt;1~Hz). Intrinsic attenuation dominates over scattering attenuation, which is caused by small-scale velocity heterogeneity. The crustal parameters obtained in this study are useful for evaluating peak ground velocities and coda envelopes for moderate crustal earthquakes via physical-based simulations using a 3-D heterogeneous structure model.},

In the finite-difference method (FDM), which has been widely used for seismic modeling, approaches to model land topography (free-surface boundary) and schemes for ocean-bottom topography (liquid-solid boundary) have been independently presented and described. For the staggered-grid FDM, Ohminato and Chouet (1997, BSSA) proposed a stable and practical technique implementing free-surface topography whose exact location is chosen such that it follows a staircase approximating the topography surface. On the other hand a similar stable technique but for liquid-solid boundary topography was described by Okamoto and Takenaka (2005, Zisin). In this study we describe a unified approach based on both techniques to model structures with both land topography and ocean-bottom topography. It is simple and can be easily implemented with existing FDM codes. We also show some numerical examples to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.},

  abstract = {The small-strain damping ratio (Dmin) is a key parameter in site response models and using values from laboratory tests tends to overpredict the site response because laboratory tests cannot capture the wave scattering effects that are present in the field. In this study, earthquake motions from four downhole array sites are used to investigate the increase in Dmin, as quantified by the Dmin multiplier applied to the laboratory based Dmin, required to match the site response. Empirical observations from the downhole array data are compared with theoretical results from linear-viscoelastic, one-dimensional site response analysis. Different measures of ground response are considered when evaluating the site response: the acceleration transfer function (TF), the spectral acceleration amplification factor (AF), the surface motion peak ground acceleration (PGA), peak ground velocity (PGV), and Arias Intensity (Ia), and the change in the high-frequency spectral decay parameter (Δκ) between the downhole and surface sensors. It is recommended that the Dmin multiplier for a site be selected to best match the Ia rather than the TF. Across the four sites, the required Dmin multiplier varies from 1.5 to 5.5. It is hypothesized that the magnitude of the Dmin multiplier may be related to the geologic depositional environment of the site, with larger Dmin multipliers associated with more spatially variable geologic conditions. These conditions have more variation in shear wave velocity across a site, which leads to more wave scattering and larger Dmin multipliers.

  abstract = {Because one-dimensional (1D) ground response analysis remains the state-of-practice for geotechnical earthquake engineering, one crucial task is to identify whether the response of a site can be modeled well by 1D analysis. In this study, ground response analyses incorporating 1D transfer functions (TF) and the H/V Spectral Ratio (HVSR) technique are carried out for 34 downhole array sites and used to develop a taxonomy that assesses the suitability of 1D analysis for a site. The empirical HVSR is used to identify the first-mode resonant frequency of the site, and the within and outcrop TF are used to distinguish true outcrop-resonances from pseudo-resonances. The taxonomy is focused on capturing outcrop-resonances rather than pseudo-resonances because pseudo-resonances are an artifact of downhole array sites and are not present in the outcropping analysis of nondownhole array sites. Using the proposed taxonomy, 69\% of the sites are considered suitable for 1D analysis, which is a much larger percentage than found in other studies. This more favorable result is a direct result of considering only true-resonances in the assessment of 1D applicability. This taxonomy system is developed using downhole array data but it can be applied to any site (even non-downhole array sites) in which the empirical HVSR curve and shear wave velocity profile are measured, making it easily applied in engineering practice.},

  abstract = {This paper compares measured and predicted site response at the Garner Valley Downhole Array (GVDA) using a wide range of shear wave velocity (Vs) profiles developed from both borehole methods and inversion of surface wave data. Only low amplitude ground motions, resulting in approximately linear-viscoelastic site response between the downhole accelerometer and the surface accelerometers, were considered in this study. Thus, uncertainties associated with the small-strain Vs profiles used for site response predictions play a considerable role in attempting to match the recorded site response and its associated variability. Prior to our study, two borehole Vs profiles extending into rock were available for the site. However, their predicted/theoretical transfer functions (TTFs) were quite different and in poor agreement with the measured/empirical transfer functions (ETFs). These differences provided motivation to collect and interpret an extensive set of active-source and passive-wavefield surface wave measurements in an attempt to develop deep Vs profiles for the site that might be used to more accurately model the measured site response and its associated variability. Suites of non-unique Vs profiles developed from inversion of the surface wave data visually exhibited considerable differences, yet their predicted TTFs matched the measured ETFs very well. These results provide further evidence that surface wave dispersion data and horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio curves represent an experimental “site signature” that can be used as a quantitative means of assessing whether candidate Vs profiles are appropriate for use in site response analyses.},

  abstract = {We seek to characterize the likelihood of multiple fault activation along a branched normal-fault system during earthquake rupture using dynamic finite element analyses. This is motivated by the normal faults in the vicinity of Yucca Mountain, Nevada, a potential site for a high-level radioactive waste repository. The Solitario Canyon fault (SCF), a north–south trending fault located approximately 1~km west of the crest of Yucca Mountain, is the most active of these faults. Based on the results of previous branching work by Kame et~al. (2003), branch activation in the hanging wall of a normal fault such as the SCF may be possible for fast ruptures propagating near the Rayleigh-wave speed at the branch junction. Dynamic branch activation along a splay of the SCF during a seismic event could have important effects on the rupture velocity and resulting ground motions at the proposed repository site. We consider elastic as well as a pressure-dependent elastic–plastic response of the off-fault material. We find that based on the regional stress state in the area, the only likely candidates for branch activation in the hanging wall of the SCF are more steeply westward dipping intrablock splay faults. We also find that the rupture velocity for an earthquake propagating updip along the SCF must reach supershear speeds in order for dynamic branch activation to occur. Branch activation can have significant effects on the ground motions at the proposed repository site, 1~km away from the SCF beneath the crest of Yucca Mountain, causing the repository site to experience a second peak in large vertical particle velocities. Elastic–plastic response near the branch junction reduces peak ground velocities and accelerations at the proposed repository site.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present article is to further check the use of the horizontal-to-vertical (h/v) spectral ratio, which has been recently suggested as an indicator of site effects. The data set consists of 1t0, three-component, high sensitivity accelerograms, recorded at five different depths by the Garner Valley Downhole Array (GVDA), in southern California, with peak ground accelerations 0.0002 g \_--{$<$} ag 0.04 g, magnitudes 3.0 ML 4.6, and hypocentral distances 16 km = R = 107 km. First, the stability of the (h/v) spectral ratio is investigated by computing the mean for the whole data set in different depths. The (h/v) spectral ratio on the surface is compared with the surface-to-depth standard spectral ratio, with theoretical S-wave transfer functions derived from the vertical geotechnical profile, as well as with the (h/v) spectral ratio of synthetic accelerograms generated by the discrete wavenumber method. Both theoretical and experimental data show a good stability of the (h/v) spectral ratio shape, which is in good agreement with the local geological structure and is insensitive to the source location and mechanism. However, the absolute level of the (h/v) spectral ratio depends on the wave field and is different from the surface-to-depth spectral ratio. Consequently the (h/v) spectral ratio technique provides only partially the information that can be obtained from a downhole array. But surface-to-depth ratios may also be misleading because they combine effects at surface and at depth.},

The difference between the ETF and either of the TTFs is substantially larger than the difference between the two TTFs computed from different estimates of the seismic properties. We show that the plane SH-wave TTF through a laterally homogeneous medium at vertical incidence inadequately models observed amplifications at most sites for both slowness estimates, obtained via downhole measurements and the spectral analysis of surface waves. Strategies to improve the predictions can be separated into two broad categories: improving the measurement of soil properties and improving the theory that maps the 1D soil profile onto spectral amplification. Using an example site where the 1D plane SH-wave formulation poorly predicts the ETF, we find a more satisfactory fit to the ETF by modeling the full wavefield and incorporating spatially correlated variability of the seismic properties. We conclude that our ability to model the observed site response transfer function is limited largely by the assumptions of the theoretical formulation rather than the uncertainty of the soil property estimates.},

Thus, there is a critical need to increase the number of sites that are used to compare soil constitutive models. Toward this end, we develop a classification scheme for downhole arrays that identifies stations where common wave propagation assumptions are valid. For stations where the onedimensional (1D) assumption does not hold, we identify different levels of complexity that must be accounted for, which is a function of the inter-event variability and the similarity between the empirical and one-dimensional theoretical transfer functions. The classification is based on 100 seismic arrays in Japan that have recorded surface accelerations in excess of 0.3g, 69 of which exhibit low interevent variability. The response at 16 of these sites resembles the one-dimensional response, while the others deviate from one-dimensional behavior, indicating that the one-dimensional assumption is not acceptable in most cases. We check our interpretation of the taxonomy with field investigations at two stations. The field observations show large lateral variations of the velocity profile across distances of hundreds of meters at the station where we expect the one-dimensional assumption does not hold.},

  abstract = {For many earthquake engineering applications, site response is estimated through empirical correlations with the time-averaged shear-wave velocity to 30 m depth (VS30). These applications therefore depend on the availability of either sitespecific VS30 measurements or VS30 maps at local, regional, and global scales. Because VS30 measurements are sparse, a proxy frequently is needed to estimate VS30 at unsampled locations. We present a new VS30 map for California, which accounts for observational constraints from multiple sources and spatial scales, such as geology, topography, and site-specific VS30 measurements. We apply the geostatistical approach of regression kriging (RK) to combine these constraints for predicting VS30. For the VS30 trend, we start with geology-based VS30 values and identify two distinct trends between topographic gradient and the residuals from the geology VS30 model. One trend applies to deep and fine Quaternary alluvium, whereas the second trend is slightly stronger and applies to Pleistocene sedimentary units. The RK framework ensures that the resulting map of California is locally refined to reflect the rapidly expanding database of VS30 measurements throughout California. We compare the accuracy of the new mapping method to a previously developed map of VS30 for California. We also illustrate the sensitivity of ground motions to the new VS30 map by comparing real and scenario ShakeMaps with VS30 values from our new map to those for existing VS30 maps.},

This seismic reflectivity from around the 410 km discontinuity indicates the presence of pronounced heterogeneity in the depth interval between 320 and 450 km in the Earth’s mantle. We model the seismic observations by heterogeneity in the form of random seismic scatterers with typical scale lengths of kilometre size (10–40 km by 2–10 km) in a 100–140 km thick depth interval. The observed heterogeneity may be explained by changes in the depths to the α–β–γ spinel transformations caused by an unexpectedly high iron content at the top of the mantle Transition Zone. The phase transformation of pyroxenes into the garnet mineral majorite probably also contributes to the reflectivity, mainly below a depth of 400 km, whereas we find it unlikely that the presence of water or partial melt is the main cause of the observed strong seismic reflectivity. Subducted oceanic slabs that equilibrated at the top of the Transition Zone may also contribute to the observed reflectivity. If this is the main cause of the reflectivity, a substantial amount of young oceanic lithosphere has been subducted under Siberia and North America during their geologic evolution. Subducted slabs may have initiated metamorphic reactions in the original mantle rocks.},

  abstract = {In this study, we aim to understand the dependence of the critical slip weakening distance (Dc) on the final slip (Dtot) during the propagation of a dynamic rupture and the consistency of their inferred correlation. To achieve this goal we have performed a series of numerical tests suitably designed to validate the adopted numerical procedure and to verify the actual capability in measuring Dc. We have retrieved two kinematic rupture histories from spontaneous dynamic rupture models governed by a slip weakening law in which a constant Dc distribution on the fault plane as well as a constant Dc/Dtot ratio are assumed, respectively. The slip velocity and the shear traction time histories represent the synthetic ‘real’ target data which we aim to reproduce. We use a 3-D traction-at-split nodes numerical procedure to image the dynamic traction evolution by assuming our modelled slip velocity as a boundary condition on the fault plane. We assume a regularized Yoffe function as source time function in our modelling attempts and we measure the critical slip weakening distance from the inferred traction versus slip curves at each point on the fault. We compare the inferred values with those of the target dynamic models. Our numerical tests show that fitting the slip velocity functions of the target models at each point on the fault plane is not enough to retrieve good traction evolution curves and to obtain reliable measures of Dc. We find that the estimation of Dc is very sensitive to any small variation of the slip velocity function. An artificial correlation between Dc/Dtot is obtained when a fixed shape of slip velocity is assumed on the fault (i.e. constant rise time and constant time for positive acceleration) which differs from that of the target model. We point out that the estimation of fracture energy (breakdown work) on the fault is not affected by biases in measuring Dc.},

This function is derived from a source-time function first proposed by Yoffe (1951), which yields a traction evolution showing a slip-weakening behavior. In order to remove its singularity, we apply a convolution with a triangular function and obtain a regularized source-time function called the regularized Yoffe function. We propose a parameterization of this slip-velocity time function through the final slip, its duration, and the duration of the positive slip acceleration (Tacc). Using this analytical function, we examined the relation between kinematic parameters, such as peak slip velocity and slip duration, and dynamic parameters, such as slip-weakening distance and breakdown-stress drop. The obtained scaling relations are consistent with those proposed by Ohnaka and Yamashita (1989) from laboratory experiments. This shows that the proposed source-time function suitably represents dynamic rupture propagation with finite slip-weakening distances.},

High-frequency peak accelerations of 1.25 g were recorded in two horizontal directions, these being the highest ground accelerations so far recorded for earthquakes. Response spectrum curves calculated from the accelerograms do not show unusual features, and the numerical values are consistent with past experience. The high-frequency, high-amplitude impulsive ground motion associated with the highest peak accelerations did not contribute significantly to the over-all response spectrum values. The presence of the high-frequency motions in the recorded accelerograms is presumably the consequence of the proximity of the recording site to the fault dislocation.},

The topographic amplifications of seismic waves were estimated using five aftershocks recorded on the mountain-top and at the foot. Average amplitude ratios (mountain-top: foot) of seismic waves are 2–7 in the frequency range concerned. The high acceleration area defined by the distribution of thrown-out boulders is very small (1× 3 km) compared with the length (12 km) of the assumed main fault. Many cracks were also found in this limited small area, which is characterized by extremely low activity of aftershocks and relatively large dislocation.},

  abstract = {Finite-difference (FD) techniques are widely used to model wave propagation through complex structures. Two main sources of error can be identified: (1) from numerical dispersion and numerical anisotropy and (2) by modeling the response of internal grid boundaries. Conventional discretization criteria to reduce the effects of numerical dispersion and numerical anisotropy have long been established (5-8gridpoints per wavelength for a fourth-order accurate FD scheme). We analyze the second source of errors, comparing different staggered-grid FD solutions to the Cagniard-de Hoop solution in models with fluid-solid contacts. Our results confirm that it is sufficient to rely on conventional discretization criteria if the fluid-solid interface is aligned with the grid. If accurate modeling of the Scholte wave is required, then a new imaging method we propose should be used to allow for conventional sampling of the wavefield to minimize numerical dispersion. However, for an interface not aligned with the grid (irregular interfaces), a spatial sampling of at least 15 gridpoints per minimum wavelength is required to obtain acceptable results, particularly in seismic seabed applications where Scholte waves may need to be modeled more accurately.},

Notable features of the event include (1) the dominance of a slip pulse of about 6‐s duration that unlocked the lower edge of the MHT and (2) the near‐horizontal fault geometry, which, combined with proximity of the free surface, allows surface‐reflected phases to break the across‐fault symmetries of the seismic wavefield. Our dynamic rupture simulations in an elastoplastic medium yield earthquake parameters comparable to those deduced from kinematic inversions, including seismic moment and rupture velocity. The simulations reproduce pulse‐like behavior predicting pulse widths in agreement with those kinematic studies and supporting an interpretation in which the pulse‐like time dependence of slip is principally controlled by rupture geometry. This inference is strongly supported by comparison of synthetic ground velocity with the near‐field high‐rate GPS recording at station KKN4, which shows close agreement in pulse width, amplitude, and pulse shape. That comparison also constrains the updip extent of rupture and disfavors significant coseismic slip on the shallow ramp segment. Over most of the rupture length, the simulated rupture propagates at a near‐constant maximum velocity (\textasciitilde 90\% of the S wave speed) that is controlled by the antiplane geometry and off‐fault plastic yielding. Simulations also reveal the role of reflected seismic waves from the free surface, which may have contributed \textasciitilde 30\% elongation of the slip pulse, and show the potential for significant free‐surface interaction effects in shallow events of similar geometry.},

  abstract = {Source parameters for historical earthquakes worldwide are compiled to develop a series of empirical relationships among moment magnitude (M), surface rupture length, subsurface rupture length, downdip rupture width, rupture area, and maximum and average displacement per event. The resulting data base is a significant update of previous compilations and includes the additional source parameters of seismic moment, moment magnitude, subsurface rupture length, downdip rupture width, and average surface displacement. Each source parameter is classified as reliable or unreliable, based on our evaluation of the accuracy of individual values. Only the reliable source parameters are used in the final analyses. In comparing source parameters, we note the following trends: (1) Generally, the length of rupture at the surface is equal to 75\% of the subsurface rupture length; however, the ratio of surface rupture length to subsurface rupture length increases with magnitude; (2) the average surface displacement per event is about one-half the maximum surface displacement per event; and (3) the average subsurface displacement on the fault plane is less than the maximum surface displacement but more than the average surface displacement. Thus, for most earthquakes in this data base, slip on the fault plane at seismogenic depths is manifested by similar displacements at the surface. Log-linear regressions between earthquake magnitude and surface rupture length, subsurface rupture length, and rupture area are especially well correlated, showing standard deviations of 0.25 to 0.35 magnitude units. Most relationships are not statistically different (at a 95\% significance level) as a function of the style of faulting: thus, we consider the regressions for all slip types to be appropriate for most applications. Regressions between magnitude and displacement, magnitude and rupture width, and between displacement and rupture length are less well correlated and have larger standard deviation than regressions between magnitude and length or area. The large number of data points in most of these regressions and their statistical stability suggest that they are unlikely to change significantly in response to additional data. Separating the data according to extensional and compressional tectonic environments neither provides statistically different results nor improves the statistical significance of the regressions. Regressions for cases in which earthquake magnitude is either the independent or the dependent parameter can be used to estimate maximum earthquake magnitudes both for surface faults and for subsurface seismic sources such as blind faults, and to estimate the expected surface displacement along a fault for a given size earthquake.},

  abstract = {Consideration of site conditions is a vital step in analyzing and predicting earthquake ground motion. The importance of amplification by soil conditions has long been recognized, but though many seismic-instrument sites have been characterized by their geologic conditions, there has been no consistent, simple classification applied to all sites. As classification of sites by shear-wave velocity has become more common, the need to go back and provide a simple uniform classification for all stations has become apparent. Within the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center’s Next Generation Attenuation equation project, developers of attenuation equations recognized the need to consider site conditions and asked that the California Geological Survey provide site conditions information for all stations that have recorded earthquake ground motion in California. To provide these estimates, we sorted the available shear-wave velocity data by geologic unit, generalized the geologic units, and prepared a map so that we could use the extent of the map units to transfer the velocity characteristics from the sites where they were measured to sites on the same or similar materials. This new map is different from the California Geological Survey “preliminary site-conditions map of California” in that 19 geologically defined categories are used, rather than National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program categories. Although this map does not yet cover all of California, when completed it may provide a basis for more precise consideration of site conditions in ground-motion calculations.},

  abstract = {Correlations between geologic units and shear-wave velocity form the basis of a series of maps developed over the past 15 years to estimate the time-averaged shear-wave velocity in the upper 30 m (VS30). The Wills et al. (2000) site-condition map for California was found to correlate with seismic amplification (Field, 2000) and was adopted as a standard depiction for many applications of seismic shaking estimates (ShakeMap, for example). Wills and Clahan (2006) modified that map to show simplified geologic units and corresponding VS30 values. Preparation of this map raised a number of questions on how best to distinguish units within younger alluvium. Wills and Gutierrez (2011) found that a simple system based on surface slope could be used to subdivide the younger alluvium into three classes that have distinct VS30 ranges. The classes defined by slope have approximately the same variability in VS30 as the previously defined classes, but the total number of classes is reduced and the system can be easily applied to other tectonically active areas. We have now applied the system of Wills and Gutierrez (2011) to create a new map of California using the most detailed available geologic maps. Use of more detailed geologic maps, from 1:250,000 scale to 1:24,000 for much of California, results in a much more detailed and accurate depiction of the surficial geology and, we anticipate, a more detailed and accurate depiction of seismic amplification due to the near-surface materials.},

  abstract = {Memory-variable methods have been widely applied to approximate frequency-independent quality factor Q in numerical simulation of wave propagation. The frequency-independent model is often appropriate for frequencies up to about 1 Hz but at higher frequencies is inconsistent with some regional studies of seismic attenuation. We apply the memory-variable approach to frequency-dependent Q models that are constant below, and follow a power-law above, a chosen transition frequency. We present numerical results for the corresponding memory-variable relaxation times and weights, obtained by nonnegative least-squares fitting of the Qf  function, for a range of exponent values; these times and weights can be scaled to an arbitrary transition frequency and a power-law prefactor, respectively. The resulting memory-variable formulation can be used with numerical wave-propagation solvers based on methods such as finite differences (FDs) or spectral elements and may be implemented in either conventional or coarse-grained form. In the coarse-grained approach, we fit effective Q for low-Q values ({$<$} 200) using a nonlinear inversion technique and use an interpolation formula to find the corresponding weighting coefficients for arbitrary Q. A 3D staggered-grid FD implementation closely approximates the frequency–wavenumber solution to both a half-space and a layered model with a shallow dislocation source for Q as low as 20 over a bandwidth of two decades. We compare the effects of different power-law exponents using a finite-fault source model of the 2008 Mw 5.4 Chino Hills, California, earthquake and find that Qf  models generally better fit the strong-motion data than the constant Q models for frequencies above 1 Hz.},

In this paper, we apply radiative transfer theory to seismic wave propagation and formulate in the frequency domain the energy density distribution in space for a point source. We consider the cases of isotropic scattering and strong forward scattering. Some numerical examples are shown. It is seen that the energy density—distance curves have quite different shapes depending on the values of medium seismic albedo B0 = ηs/(ηs + ηa) where ηs is the scattering coefficient and ηa is the absorption coefficient of the medium. For a high albedo (B \&gt; 0.5) medium, the energy—distance curve is of arch shape and the position of the peak is a function of the extinction coefficient of the medium ηe = ηs + ηa. Therefore it is possible to separate the scattering effect and the absorption based on the measured energy density distribution curves.},

Site conditions consist of about 70 m of medium-dense sands overlying clayey bedrock, with groundwater located at 45 m. Ground shaking at the bedrock level had a geometric mean peak acceleration of 0.55g, which reduced to 0.4g at the ground surface, indicating nonlinear site response. One-dimensional ground response analysis of relatively weak motion aftershock data provides good matches of the observed resonant site frequencies and amplification levels, provided small-strain damping levels somewhat larger than those from laboratory tests are applied. Nonlinear ground response analyses of strong-motion data using laboratory-based modulus reduction and damping relations valid up to moderate strain levels (, ∼0:5\%) produce unrealistic strain localization at a velocity contrast. A procedure is presented to more realistically represent the large-strain portion of backbone curves by asymptotically approaching the shear strength at large strains, which removes strain localization for this application and provides reasonable matches of observed and computed ground motions.

  abstract = {In this paper we provide a complete formulation of scattered wave energy propagation in a random isotropic scattering medium. First, we formulate the scattered wave energy equation by extending the stationary energy transport theory studied by Wu (1985) to the time dependent case. The iterative solution of this equation gives us a general expression of temporal variation of scattered energy density at arbitrary source and receiver locations as a Neumann series expansion characterized by powers of the scattering coefficient. The first term of this series leads to the first-order scattering formula obtained by Sato (1977). For the source and receiver coincident case, our solution gives the corrected version of high-order formulas obtained by Gao et al. (1983b). Solving the scattered wave energy equation using a Fourier transform technique, we obtain a compact integral solution for the temporal decay of scattered wave energy which includes all multiple scattering contributions and can be easily computed numerically. Examples of this solution are presented and compared with that of the single scattering, energy flux, and diffusion models. We then discuss the energy conservation for our system by starting with our fundamental scattered wave energy equation and then demonstrating that our formulas satisfy the energy conservation when the contributions from all orders of scattering are summed up. We also generalize our scattered wave energy equations to the case of nonuniformly distributed isotropic scattering and absorption coefficients. To solve these equations, feasible numerical procedures, such as a Monte Carlo simulation scheme, are suggested. Our Monte Carlo approach to solve the wave energy equation is different from previous works (Gusev and Abubakirov, 1987; Hoshiba, 1990) based on the ray theoretical approach.},

In this paper, we extend our discussion of the source by allowing subevent rake to vary within the positive strain quadrant and by including the effect of the random lateral heterogeneity of the earth by adding scattered waves into the Green's function computed from a layered elastic earth model. Both of these variations contribute towards equalizing different components of the high frequency waveform train. The random scattering has the stronger effect on increasing the amplitudes of the nodal components.

It is based on a scattered elastic wave energy equation that extends the work of Zeng et al. (1991) on multiple scattering by considering S to P and P to S wave scattering conversions. We obtain a complete solution of the scattered elastic wave energy equation by solving the equation in the frequency/wave-number domain. Using a discrete wave-number sum technique combined with a modified repeated averaging and the FFT method, we compute numerically the complete solution. By considering that the scattering conversion from P- to S-wave energy is about (α/β)4 times greater than that from S to P waves (Aki, 1992), we found that the P-wave scattering field was converted quickly to the S-wave scattering field, leading to the conclusion that coda waves generated from both P- and S-wave sources are actually dominated by scattered S waves. We also compared our result with that obtained under the acoustic wave assumption. The acoustic wave assumption for seismic coda works quite well for the scattered S-wave field but fails for the scattered P-wave field. Our scattered elastic wave energy equation provides a theoretical foundation for studying the scattered wave field generated by a P-wave source such as an explosion. The scattered elastic wave energy equation can be easily generalized to an inhomogeneous random scattering medium by considering variable scattering and absorption coefficients and elastic wave velocities in the earth.},

  abstract = {Surface topography has been considered a difficult task for seismic wave numerical modelling by the finite-difference method (FDM) because the most popular staggered finite-difference scheme requires a rectilinear grid. Even though there are numerous collocated grid schemes in other computational fields that could be used to solve the first-order hyperbolic equations, the lack of a stable free-surface boundary condition implementation for curvilinear grids also obstructs the adoption of curvilinear grids in seismic wave FDM modelling. In this study, we use generalized curvilinear grids that can fit the surface topography to discretize the computational domain and describe the implementation of a collocated grid finite-difference scheme, a higher order MacCormack scheme, to solve the first-order hyperbolic velocity-stress equations on the curvilinear grid. To achieve a sufficiently accurate and stable free-surface boundary condition implementation on the curvilinear grids, we propose the traction image method that antisymmetrically images the traction components instead of the stress components to the ghost points above the free surface. Since the velocity derivatives at the free surface are provided by the free-surface condition, we use a compact scheme to compute the velocity derivatives near the free surface and avoid the use of velocity values on the ghost points. Numerical tests verify that using the curvilinear grid, the collocated finite-difference scheme and the traction image technique can simulate seismic wave propagation in the presence of surface topography with sufficient accuracy.},

  abstract = {In this study, we propose a new numerical method, named as Traction Image method, to accurately and efficiently implement the traction-free boundary conditions in finite difference simulation in the presence of surface topography. In this algorithm, the computational domain is discretized by boundary-conforming grids, in which the irregular surface is transformed into a ‘flat’ surface in computational space. Thus, the artefact of staircase approximation to arbitrarily irregular surface can be avoided. Such boundary-conforming gridding is equivalent to a curvilinear coordinate system, in which the first-order partial differential velocity-stress equations are numerically updated by an optimized high-order non-staggered finite difference scheme, that is, DRP/opt MacCormack scheme. To satisfy the free surface boundary conditions, we extend the Stress Image method for planar surface to Traction Image method for arbitrarily irregular surface by antisymmetrically setting the values of normal traction on the grid points above the free surface. This Traction Image method can be efficiently implemented. To validate this new method, we perform numerical tests to several complex models by comparing our results with those computed by other independent accurate methods. Although some of the testing examples have extremely sloped topography, all tested results show an excellent agreement between our results and those from the reference solutions, confirming the validity of our method for modelling seismic waves in the heterogeneous media with arbitrary shape topography. Numerical tests also demonstrate the efficiency of this method. We find about 10 grid points per shortest wavelength is enough to maintain the global accuracy of the simulation. Although the current study is for 2-D P-SV problem, it can be easily extended to 3-D problem.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear site response of deep offshore clay deposit plays an important role in changing the characteristics of ground motions when subjected to strong shaking, especially when different amplification behaviors of acceleration and displacement are considered. The paper describes a series of centrifuge shaking table tests and numerical simulations to investigate the behavior of deep offshore clay deposits subjected to earthquake loadings. The centrifuge model tests were performed on a slightly overconsolidated clay deposit at UC Davis. A suite of shaking tests were conducted including impulse step wave testing, frequency sweeps, a small “elastic” earthquake event and a “ductility” level large earthquake event. Accelerations, displacements and pore pressures were measured in the soils (free field) throughout the test program. For the elastic level excitations, about a 33\% amplification was observed between the input acceleration at the base and the measured accelerations near the top of the clay deposit. However, for the ductility-level earthquake excitation, which had peak input acceleration at the base of 0.46g, acceleration near the top of the deposit was reduced to 0.07g. These observations are correctly simulated by DEEPSOIL with proper soil models and parameters back analyzed from the centrifuge model test. Then systematic 1-D site response analyses are performed on synthetic clay deposit models with 30 to 120 m depths using the validated DEEPSOIL program, and the amplification characteristics of acceleration and deformation induced by base excitation with different intensities and frequencies are analyzed in both time and frequency domains. The results reveal that for deep soft offshore clay deposits subjected to large earthquakes, significant acceleration attenuation may occur near the top of deposit due to soil nonlinearity and even local shear failure; however, significant amplification of displacement at low frequencies is expected regardless of the intensities of base motions, which suggests that for displacement sensitive offshore foundations and structures, such amplified low-frequency displacement response will play an important role in seismic design.},

  abstract = {We propose a new approach to study the scattering problem of seismic waves by an irregular topography. It is rooted in the Bouchon–Campillo method that can provide accurate enough solutions for most of the problems, but the expensive computation cost, especially for the highfrequency problem, limited its application. In this study, we develop a new approach to study seismic waves scattering problem by an irregular topography, in which only those sampling points over the irregular part of surface topography are directly solved; thus the number of unknowns is greatly reduced. Comparisons with analytical solution and other existing validated methods show the computational efficiency of our new method is much superior to the original Bouchon–Campillo method, and is expected to be a powerful tool in simulating the seismic wave scattering problem by an arbitrary topography.},

  abstract = {We use cross-correlations of ambient seismic noise between pairs of 158 broadband and short-period sensors to investigate velocity structure over the top 5–10~km of the crust in the Southern California plate boundary region around the San Jacinto Fault Zone (SJFZ). From the 9-component correlation tensors associated with all station pairs we derive dispersion curves of Rayleigh and Love wave group velocities. The dispersion results are inverted first for Rayleigh and Love waves group velocity maps on a 1.5~×~1.5~km2 grid that includes portions of the SJFZ, the San Andreas Fault (SAF), and the Elsinore fault. We then invert these maps to 3D shear wave velocities in the top \textasciitilde 7~km of the crust. The distributions of the Rayleigh and Love group velocities exhibit 2θ azimuthal anisotropy with fast directions parallel to the main faults and rotations in complex areas. The reconstructed 3D shear velocity model reveals complex shallow structures correlated with the main geological units, and strong velocity contrasts across various fault sections along with low-velocity damage zones and basins. The SJFZ is marked by a clear velocity contrast with higher Vs values on the NE block for the section SE of the San Jacinto basin and a reversed contrast across the section between the San Jacinto basin and the SAF. Velocity contrasts are also observed along the southern parts on the SAF and the Elsinore fault, with a faster southwest block in both cases. The region around the Salton Trough is associated with a significant low-velocity zone. Strong velocity reductions following flower-shape with depth are observed extensively around both the SJFZ and the SAF, and are especially prominent in areas of geometrical complexity. In particular, the area between the SJFZ and the SAF is associated with an extensive low-velocity zone correlated with diffuse seismicity at depth, and a similar pattern including correlation with deep diffuse seismicity is observed on a smaller scale in the trifurcation area of the SJFZ. These results augment local earthquake tomography images that have low resolution in the top few km of the crust, and provide important constraints for studies concerned with behavior of earthquake ruptures, generation of rock damage, and seismic shaking hazard in the region.},
