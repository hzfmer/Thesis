We have simulated 0-5 Hz deterministic simulations for the 2014 $M_w$ 5.1 La Habra, CA, earthquake in a mesh from the Southern California Earthquake Center Community Velocity Model CVM-S4.26-M01 and a finite-fault source. The seismic velocities in the top 1000 m of the mesh were updated constrained by near-surface shear-wave velocities. We include statistical distributions of small-scale crustal heterogeneities (SSHs) with an anisotropic von Karman autocorrelation to represent the effects of realistic velocity and density perturbations, frequency-dependent attenuation $Q(f)$, $V_{S30}$-based near-surface velocity calibration and surface topography using a curvilinear grid. Strong motion data at 259 sites within an 148 km by 140 km area are used to validate our simulations. Our results show that the effects of topography, SSHs and $Q(f)$ become increasingly important and should be included as frequencies increase. Particularly, topography and SSHs predominantly decrease the peak velocities and significantly increase the duration, providing an improved fit to the data. Frequency-dependent attenuation also improves the fit to the data, including the high frequency decay in the Fourier amplitude spectra. The results provide guidance on the importance of the different features controlling high-frequency seismic hazard analysis.

\section{Introduction} \label{highf:intro}
It is the ultimate goal for ground motion modelers to deliver their results to engineers and see their work used in applications beneficial for society, such as structural design. This is particularly useful in cases of infrequent observations, such as large magnitude events at small distances from the fault, where simulations may provide a viable alternative to data. Deterministic ground motion predictions, including features such as three-dimensional (3D) velocity structure and frequency-independent anelastic attenuation are now routinely produced for frequencies up to about 1 Hz with generally satisfactory fit to recorded data \citeg{gravesSimulatingSeismicWave1996,olsen2009shakeout,roten3DSimulationsEarthquakes2012,}. These simulations have proved to be useful in public earthquake emergency response and seismic hazard management \citep{gravesBroadbandGroundMotionSimulation2010}, and complementing empirical ground motion prediction models in regions with sparse stations coverage \citeg{dayModelBasinEffects2008}.

While the results of these low-frequency simulations are promising, structural engineers need ground motions with signal content up to 5 Hz and higher for design purposes. Hybrid techniques, combining deterministic low-frequency and stochastic high-frequency signals \citeg{olsen2015sdsu,gravesKinematicGroundMotion2016} can be used to generate synthetic seismograms with frequency content up to 10 Hz and higher. However, simulating both the lower and higher frequency content using a deterministic approach has the potential to lower part of the epistemic uncertainty in the resulting ground motion estimates. In this study we investigate the feasibility of increasing the highest frequency for the deterministic ground motion predictions to 5 Hz, using simulations and data for the 2014 $M_w$ 5.1 La Habra, CA, earthquake. The La Habra event was chosen due to an abundance of records available in the greater Los Angeles area, while ground motions can be considered linear due to its relatively small magnitude.


As frequencies increase above about 1 Hz, features with increasingly small length scales become important to realistically predict deterministic ground motions. For example, small-scale complexity of both the source and surrounding media, on the order of 10-100s of meters, is expected to increasingly affect the ground motion predictions at higher frequencies. Frequency-independent anelastic attenuation, often chosen as proportional to the local velocity structure \citeg{gravesBroadbandGroundMotionSimulation2010} is usually a good approximation for lower frequencies \citep[e.g., up to ~1 Hz][]{liu1976velocity,fehler1992separation}. However, models of frequency-independent anelastic attenuation appear to be inconsistent with seismic records at higher frequencies where regional studies indicate that larger Q values may be more accurate \citeg{withersMemoryEfficientSimulation2015}. Finally, ground motion simulations often artificially truncate the lowest near-surface velocities due to computational limitations, which may be a reasonable approximation for lower frequencies \citeg{olsenEstimationLongPeriodSec2003}. However, stronger effects from this near-surface material emerge as frequencies increase and wavelengths decrease \citeg{pitarka2009simulating,imperatoriBroadbandNearfieldGround2013}. Here, we quantify the effects of all of these features in our 3D simulations of the La Habra event.

In southern California, two 3D state-of-the-art velocity models, namely the Community Velocity Models (CVM) versions S and H have been developed through the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC). These CVMs have been validated against ground motion data in a series of studies \citeg{tabordaEvaluationSouthernCalifornia2016,savranGroundMotionSimulation2019,laiShallowBasinStructure2020}, where conclusions often point to inaccuracies in the velocity structure, in particular for the near surface material. \citet{elyVs30derivedNearsurfaceSeismic2010} proposed a method to calibrate the near-surface material based on estimates of the time-averaged velocity in the upper 30 m ($V_{S30}$), and later improved by \citet{huCalibrationNearsurfaceSeismic2021}, specifically for sites with poor constraints in shallow velocities. In this study, we use the SCEC CVM-S4.26-M01 with the near-surface $V_S$ tapering method proposed by \citet{huCalibrationNearsurfaceSeismic2021}.

The effects of irregular surface topography on ground motions also play an increasingly large role as frequencies increase \citeg{liuScatteringSeismicWaves2020}. In addition, in recent studies, theoretical and numerical methods have helped clarify the interaction between seismic waves and topography \citep[mainly scattering and trapping of waves, e.g.,][]{imperatoriRoleTopographyLateral2015,takemura2015scattering,rodgersBroadband04Hz2018}, as well as describing the characteristic effects on ground motions. Some of the most notable effects of topography are listed in the following. (1) Amplification tends to occur at the top of relatively steep slopes for waves with comparable wavelength to the size of the topographic features; on the other hand, deamplification tends to occur at low-elevation areas \citep{trifunacAnalysisPacoimaDam1971,booreNoteEffectSimple1972,spudichDirectionalTopographicSite1996,bouchonSeismicResponseHill1996,assimakiSoilDependentTopographicEffects2005}. Amplification can range up to a factor of 10 or more between the crest and base of a topographic feature \citep{davisObservedEffectsTopography1973,geliEffectTopographyEarthquake1988,umedaHighAccelerationsProduced1987,gaffetSiteEffectStudy2000}. (2) The amplification at mountain tops is systematically larger for incident S compared with P waves, and such difference diminishes when the slope decreases or the incidence angle increases \citep{bardDiffractedWavesDisplacement1982}. (3) Body waves and surface waves are strongly scattered by irregular topography, thus reducing ground motion amplitudes while prolonging the shaking durations \citep{sanchez-sesmaDiffractionSVRayleigh1991,leeEffectsRealisticSurface2009}. (4) Topography tends to disrupt the coherency of high-frequency ground motion and thereby distorts the S-wave radiation pattern \citep{imperatoriRoleTopographyLateral2015}. Notably, 3D models of the topography are necessary to capture the amplification effects, as noted in two-dimensional (2D) simulation results \citep{geliEffectTopographyEarthquake1988,bouchonSeismicResponseHill1996}. While geometrical characteristics, such as smoothed curvature and relative elevation, have been explored to approximate topographic effects \citeg{maufroyFrequencyScaledCurvature2015,raiEmpiricalTerrainBasedTopographic2017}, they require critical parameter constraints based on local velocity and target frequency, and thus difficult to be generalized for broadband studies.

It should be noted that previous studies discussed above included only a subset of the model features deemed to be affecting high-frequency ground motions, or omitted validation of the results. In this study, we simulate ground motions for frequencies up to 5 Hz in the widely-tested SCEC CVM-S4.26M01 including high-resolution topography and compare to strong-motion data for the 2014 $M_w$ 5.1 La Habra, CA, earthquake, in order to constrain the relative contribution of topography, SSHs, and $Q(f)$. Our paper is organized as follows. We first describe the velocity model, simulation parameters, processing of the synthetic and recorded ground motions, and source description. Then the relative effects of model features such as topography, shallow near-surface velocities, small-scale heterogeneities, and $Q(f)$ will be quantified through goodness-of-fit (GOF) measures between synthetics and data, as guidelines for future simulations. Finally, we discuss future research directions based on our results.

\section{Computational Aspect}\label{approach}

In this section we describe the simulation method and model setup, and summarize the features included in our model. In addition, we outline the processing parameters for simulations and data, and introduce our goodness-of-fit (GOF) measures to validate our results.

\subsection{Numerical method for simulating ground motions}
We use the staggered-grid finite-difference (FD) code AWP-ODC \citep[Anelastic Wave Propagation, Olsen-Day-Cui, from the authors of the code, hereafter denoted by AWP;][]{cuiScalableEarthquakeSimulation2010}, which is $4^{\text{th}}$-order accurate in space and $2^{\text{nd}}$-order accurate in time, to generate ground motion predictions for the La Habra event. AWP has been adapted to GPU accelerators for kinematic sources \citep{cui2013physics}, and provides support for frequency-dependent viscoelastic attenuation \citep{withersMemoryEfficientSimulation2015} and topography using a curvilinear grid \citep{oreillySimulationElasticWaves}. The original version of AWP employs a spatially uniform grid over the entire domain, where the minimum velocity determines the grid spacing, resulting in significant over-discretization in high-velocity areas. \citet{nieFourthOrderStaggered2017} developed a method that supports discontinuous mesh (DM) for the 3D staggered-grid finite-difference scheme in AWP. The wavefields are exchanged within an overlap zone between two media partitions with a factor-of-three change in grid spacing, which significantly reduces the number of grid points needed in high-velocity regions and thereby improves the efficiency.

The accuracy of AWP has been thoroughly verified. For example, large-scale earthquake simulations in realistic 3D earth models with strong heterogeneities and complex finite-fault source descriptions \citep{bielakShakeOutEarthquakeScenario2010,bielak2016verification}, revealed good agreement between AWP, another staggered-grid FD code and a finite-element code. The DM method implemented in the scalable GPU version of AWP was verified against uniform mesh solutions for the $M_w$ 5.1 La Habra earthquake \citep{rotenHighfrequencyNonlinearEarthquake2018}. The implementation of frequency-dependent anelastic attenuation was tested by \citet{Withers2015} against a frequency-wavenumber solution, and the accuracy of the curvilinear topography implementation \citet{oreillySimulationElasticWaves} was verified against SPECFEM3D \citep{komatitschSpectralelementSimulationsGlobal2002}.

\subsection{Computational Domain}
We used a model domain of lateral dimensions 148 km by 140 km, rotated 39.9$^{\circ}$ clockwise with a depth extent of 60 km. The mesh was extracted from the SCEC CVM-S4.26-M01, an updated version of the original CVM-S4 model \citep{magistraleSCECSouthernCalifornia2000,kohlerMantleHeterogeneitiesSCEC2003} with iterative 3D full tomography inversions in Southern California \citep{leeRapidFullwaveCentroid2011}. The SCEC Uniform Community Velocity Model software framework \citep[V19.4][]{smallSCECUnifiedCommunity2017} was used for the extraction of seismic P-wave velocity ($V_P$), $V_S$ and the material density. The choice of CVM-S4.26-M01 (hereafter abbreviated with CVM-S) for this study was based on the results by \citet{tabordaEvaluationSouthernCalifornia2016} who concluded from a comprehensive validation of four velocity models with 30 earthquakes in the greater Los Angeles region that this model consistently yielded the best fit to ground motion data using a variety of metrics.

\subsection{Small-scale Heterogeneities}
Small-scale (on the order of tens to hundreds of meters) crustal heterogeneities are known to exist in nature but are insufficiently resolved in state-of-the-art velocity models. Instead, small-scale heterogeneities are commonly included in numerical simulations via statistical models of property fluctuations \citeg{imperatoriBroadbandNearfieldGround2013,savranGroundMotionSimulation2019}. Here, we superimpose a statistical model of velocity and density perturbations onto CVM-S, defined via a Von Karman shape function \citep{frankelFiniteDifferenceSimulations1986}:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:highf-1}
  \Phi_{v, a}(r)=\sigma^{2} \frac{2^{1-v}}{\Gamma(v)}\left(\frac{r}{a}\right)^{v} K_{v}\left(\frac{r}{a}\right)
\end{equation}

\noindent which has Fourier transform:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:highf-2}
  P(k)=\frac{\sigma^{2}(2 \sqrt{\pi} a)^{E} \Gamma(v+E / 2)^{v+E / 2}}{\Gamma(v)\left(1+k^{2} a^{2}\right)}
\end{equation}
\noindent in which $k$ is the wave number and $E$ is the Euclidean dimension, $\Gamma$ denotes the Gamma function, and $K$ stands for the modiﬁed Bessel function of the second kind with order $\nu$. The parameters of the Von Karman autocorrelation function include correlation length $a$, standard deviation $\sigma$ and Hurst number $\nu$. This approach generates a random field with zero mean, and the desired standard deviation is guaranteed by scaling the random variable at each computational node. We used a fixed Hurst number of 0.05 and introduced elliptical anisotropy with a ratio of horizontal-vertical correlation lengths of 5. We tested correlation lengths between 100-500 m, and standard deviation of 5\% and 10\%, based on previous studies in Southern California \citeg{nakataStochasticCharacterizationMesoscale2015,savranModelSmallscaleCrustal2016}. In our model, the random perturbations extend to a depth of 7.5 km, and then linearly tapered to a standard deviation of 0 at 10 km depth \citep{olsen2018constraints}. \Cref{fig:highf-2} shows an example realization of small-scale heterogeneities, compared to the original CVM-S in terms of $V_S$ at the surface.

\subsection{Topography}
While the the Los Angeles basins, including near the epicentral area of the La Habra event, are characterized by relatively flat topographic relief, the San Gabriel and Santa Ana Mountains bound the area to the North and East, respectively (see \cref{fig:highf-1}). To quantify the effects of topography on ground motions from the La Habra event, we use the curvilinear grid approach by \citet{oreillyHighorderFiniteDifference2021} [use the 2019 abstract until the paper is accepted]. In this version of AWP, surface topography is incorporated by stretching the computational grids in the vertical direction, while keeping the horizontal grid spacing unchanged, so that the surface grid locations conform to the shape of the topography. We include surface topography into our model domain via the $\frac{1}{3}$ arc-second resolution Digital Elevation Model in southern California from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).

\subsection{Frequency-Dependent Attenuation}
Anelastic attenuation is needed for accurate simulation of seismic wave propagation through earth models at distances further than the dominant wavelength to account for the loss of intrinsic energy. Frequency-independent attenuation, resulting in identical seismic energy loss per cycle across a frequency bandwidth, has been used successfully in numerical simulation studies \citeg{bielakShakeOutEarthquakeScenario2010,savranGroundMotionSimulation2019}. However, as frequencies increase above about 1Hz, data often supports frequency dependence of $Q$ \citeg{raoof1999attenuation,eberhart2014imaging,wangUsingDirectCoda2017}. \citet{withersMemoryEfficientSimulation2015} developed an efficient coarse-grained memory variable approach to model attenuation quality $Q$ using a power law formulation:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:highf-3}
  Q(f)=Q_{0} *\left(\frac{f}{f_{0}}\right)^{\gamma}, \quad f \geq f_{0}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $Q_0$ is frequency independent attenuation quality for $f<f_{0}$.The authors found that an exponent of 0.8 above 1 Hz produced a match with both ground motion data and Ground Motion Prediction Equations (GMPEs) up to 4 Hz, as compared to a constant $Q$ model. \citet{savranGroundMotionSimulation2019} obtained optimal results for $\gamma = 0.6$ in their 0-2.5 Hz simulations for the 2008 Chino Hills, CA, earthquake.

A popular parameterization of $Q_0$ is proportional to local seismic velocity, with separate values $Q_P$ and $Q_S$ for $V_P$ and $V_S$ quality factors, respectively, producing the expected stronger attenuation for lower velocity material \citep{haukssonAttenuationModelsThree2006}. \citet{taborda2014ground}  revised the formula expressed by \citet{brocher2008compressional} and applied a $6^{\text{th}}$-order polynomial function for $Q_S$ and $Q_P=\frac{3}{4}\left(V_P/V_S\right)^2Q_S$. We test a variety of these parameterizations of $Q_0$ for the La Habra event.

\subsection{Near-surface Geotechnical Layer}
The CVM-S model includes geotechnical data which integrates geology and geophysics data from surficial and deep boreholes, oil wells, gravity observations, seismic refraction surveys and empirical rules calibrated based on ages and depth estimates for geological horizons in southern California \citeg{magistraleGeologybased3DVelocity1996,magistraleSCECSouthernCalifornia2000}. While validation studies, such as \citet{tabordaEvaluationSouthernCalifornia2016}, have shown that basin structures of CVM-S are reasonably accurate, unrealistically large surface rock site velocities (see \Cref{fig:highf-2}) motivated the method by \citet{elyVs30derivedNearsurfaceSeismic2010} to reduce the $V_S$ in the top 350 m based on available $V_{S30}$ values. Most recently, \citet{huCalibrationNearsurfaceSeismic2021} proposed an improved velocity tapering method  which significantly improves the fitting to the Fourier spectra of the records below 1 Hz by tapering the shallow velocities in the original, untapered CVM-S down to 1000 m.

\subsection{Ground Motion Simulations}
Table 1 lists the simulation parameters used in our simulations. All simulations have the same duration of 120 s and resolve wave propagation up to $f_{max}=5$ Hz by at least 5 points per minimum S-wavelength. We use two different codes: 1) AWP-DM with a flat free surface, and 2) AWP-topo with a regular, curvilinear mesh. AWP-DM was used to quantify the effects of the near-surface material with a minimum $V_S$ of 200 m/s using 3 different mesh discretations: 1) dx=8 m from the surface to 1,472 m, 2) dx=24 m between 1,472 m and 10,336 m, and 3) dx=72 m at deeper levels. We used a kinematic source generated following \citet{gravesKinematicGroundMotion2016}, which creates finite-fault rupture scenarios with stochastic characteristics optimized for California events. The focal mechanism was taken from the U.S. Geological Survey \citep[strike=233°, dip=77°, rake=49°; ][]{usgsEarthquakeEventsFocal2014} with a moment magnitude 5.1, fault area of 2.5 km x 2.5 km.

\subsection{Data Processing}
259 strong-motion seismic stations were used to validate the simulations. The strong motion recordings (velocity time series) are obtained from SCEC (F. Silva, Personal Communication, 07/2020), with hypocentral distance up to 90 km and signal-to-noise ratio above 3 dB. The processing procedure included the following steps: (1) low-pass filtering of the time series below 10 Hz using a zero-phase filter; (2) interpolating the time series linearly to a uniform time step; (3) tapering of at the last 2 seconds using the positive half of a Hanning window; (4) zero padding the last 5 seconds; (5) filtering the seismograms to the desired frequency, and (6) converting velocities to accelerations by a time derivative. Except for the initial 10 Hz low-pass filter, all filters used a low-cut frequency of 0.15 Hz to avoid noise interference. $4^{\text{th}}$-order Butterworth filters were used in all cases. Finally, our horizontal synthetic seismograms were rotated 39.9° clockwise.

\subsection{Goodness of fit criteria}
We used a modified subset of the goodness-of-fit metrics proposed by the methods of \citet{andersonQuantitativeMeasureGoodnessOfFit2004} and \citet{olsenGoodnessoffitCriteriaBroadband2010}for comparison of broadband seismic traces (0 to 10+ Hz). The method includes 10 different metrics, from which we selected 7, namely peak velocity (PGV), peak acceleration (PGA), energy duration (DUR), cumulative energy (ENER), response spectral acceleration averaged between 0.1 and 10 s (RS), and smoothed Fourier amplitude spectrum (FAS), as well as one additional metric, Arias intensity (AI), to compute our GOF scores. We computed the SA at frequencies linearly spaced from 0.2 to 5 Hz. Cumulative energy is calculated as the integral of the square of velocity instead: $E N E R=\int v(t)^{2} d t$. We define the DUR as the time between the arrival of 5 and 95 percent of the total energy and ENER is calculated in this window. The Arias intensity describes the cumulative energy per weight \citep{arias1970measure}, and is defined as $AI=\frac{\pi}{2 g} \int a(t)^{2} d t$, where $a(t)$ is the acceleration time series, $g$ is the gravitational acceleration and the integral is again performed in DUR. The GOF score is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{qe:highf-4}
  G_{\text {metrics }}=10 \operatorname{erfc}\left(\frac{2|x-y|}{x+y}\right)
\end{equation}
\noindent where $x$ and $y$ are two positive scalars from the metrics we selected. $G_{\text {metrics }}$ is computed for each metric and then averaged assuming equal weights combining all selected metrics except for PGV and PGA (measuring peak amplitudes), ENER and AI (measuring the time-progressive intensities), which show strong correlations within each pair and thus their weights are halved. $G_{\text {metrics }}=\frac{1}{N} \sum G_{\text {metric }}$ and three components $G_{\text {station }}=\frac{1}{3} \sum_{i=1}^3 G_{\text {metrics}, i}$, where $i$ represents three components. The GOF score for the entire simulation is calculated at the average of $G_{\text {station }}$ across all 259 stations. In general, GOF values between two signals above 4.5 and 6.5 are considered fair and very good fit, respectively.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Source Models}
Due to the stochastic characteristics of the kinematic source generator by \citet{gravesKinematicGroundMotion2016}, a series of source realizations with different random seeds are evaluated based on comparisons between spectral accelerations with records at stations within 31 km to the epicenter (R. Graves, Personal Communication, 03/04/2020). We selected three best-performed source descriptions, with varying hypocentral depths at 5, 5.5 and 6 km, respectively (see \cref{fig:highf-3}). The rupture durations are less than 2 s and sampled at an interval of 0.001 s, identical to the time step used in our simulations. The three sources tend to generate overall similar patterns of PGV for both low (< 1 Hz) and high (> 2.5 Hz) frequencies (\cref{fig:highf-4}), while Source 2 and 3 tend to generate larger amplification in the Chino Basin and toward the south, respectively. Based on this result, we limit the subsequent analysis to using Source 1 only.

\subsection{Minimum \textbf{$V_S$}}
Southern California features numerous low-velocity basins where the minimum (surface) $V_S$ in CVM-S can be much lower than the minimum value of 500 m/s that we used in our domain 1 (see \cref{tab:highf-1}). Previous studies have pointed out that soft soils, characterized by lower $V_S$ can cause significant amplification of the ground motions \citeg{anderson1984model}. To examine the effects of the low-velocity near-surface material, we performed a simulation with a minimum $V_S$ of 200 m/s (\cref{fig:highf-5}). As expected, the largest effects are observed above the basin areas that are highly correlated with the low near-surface velocities. The effect on PGV is almost an order of magnitude larger than that for DUR. At frequencies below 1 Hz, the PGV amplification is generally concentrated in basins with low near-surface $V_S$. However, as the frequency increases, the amplification in PGV extends to the surrounding low areas, including mountain valleys. For 2.5-5 Hz seismic waves, deamplification starts to show up in mountain regions, likely due to entrapment and attenuation of seismic seismic energy in the basin areas. DUR is relatively less affected by reducing the minimum $V_S$, compared to PGV and AI. While the effects of the near-surface velocities are somewhat similar for PGV and AI in pattern and amplitude, DUR shows much smaller effects. Considering that similar patterns exhibit between 0.15-1 Hz and 0.15-2.5 Hz as well as between PGV and AI, we will not show 0.15-2.5 Hz and AI in the subsequent comparison map views.

\Cref{fig:highf-6} shows the effects of the near-surface low $V_S$ quantitatively. While the low velocities cause up to 50\% or more local amplification in PGV (concentrated in central basins where most lowest velocities reside), the average effect is mostly less than 10\%. Both the mean and standard deviation of the difference between the two models increase with the frequency, but remain at a relatively low level up to 5 Hz. Thus, our results suggest that despite locally large effects in particular for the higher frequencies, omitting the effects of material with $V_S < 500$ m/s does not change the overall ground motions significantly. Based on this result, we adopt a minimum $V_S$ of 500 m/s in the remaining analysis to alleviate computational cost.


\subsection{Reference Model Response}
\Cref{fig:highf-7} shows a comparison between PGVs extracted from records and synthetics for a simulation with source 1, CVM-S including topography, $Q(f)=0.1f^{0.6}$, $Q_P=2Q_S$, shallow velocity tapered down to 1000 m \citep{huCalibrationNearsurfaceSeismic2021}, and no small-scale heterogeneities added, which is our reference case for low frequencies (0.15-1 Hz) and high frequencies (2.5-5 Hz). The minimum $V_S$ is truncated at 500 m/s (at which $V_P$ is calculated from the $V_P/V_S$ ratio in CVM-S, and density is unchanged), often necessitated by limitations of computational resources. While the overall PGV distributions are similar, the reference model tends to predict larger values to the south and west of the source, especially between 20 to 40 km, both in the low and high frequencies. On the other hand, the simulations underpredicts the PGVs beyond 40 km at frequencies above 2.5 Hz. The small overprediction in the nearfield and underprediciton in the farther field at high frequencies indicates more than expected seismic energy is trapped within the Los Angeles Basin (LAB) bounded by San Bernardino and Santa Ana Mountains (see \cref{fig:highf-2}a for locations). The slightly faster decay with distance compared to data may also suggest a slightly lower $Q$ within the LAB, and a higher $Q$ at hypocentral distances further than 40 km, especially above 2.5 Hz.

\subsection{Topography}
In this section we investigate the effects of topography, which are often ignored in numerical simulations \citeg{graves2004observed,olsenStrongShakingAngeles2006,savranGroundMotionSimulation2019}. Our analysis of topographic effects is based on simulating the reference model with topography removed.
\Cref{fig:highf-8} shows the percent difference between models with and without topography for PGV and DUR for bandwidths of 0.15-1 and 2.5-5 Hz. It is clear that topography complicates the wavefield pattern significantly, even at frequencies below 1 Hz. Consistent with previous studies \citeg{hartzell1994initial, leeEffectsRealisticSurface2009}, we observe a general deamplification of PGV below 1 Hz, and that mountain peaks and ridges tend to amplify PGV by 30-60\%. Also, PGV is reduced by about 30\% in the Chino Basin and northwest of San Gabriel Mountains. Similar phenomenon is reported by \citet{maEffectsLargeScaleSurface2007} that the San Gabriel Mountains scatter surface waves from a northern rupture on the San Andreas Fault and reduce the PGVs in the LAB by up to 50\%. We further confirm that such effects exhibit and grow stronger at even higher frequencies up to 5 Hz. We interpret these results as shielding and focusing effects on the front side and back side of the hills, respectively, which become more significant at higher frequencies, in agreement with \citet{liuScatteringSeismicWaves2020}. Also, at frequencies above 2.5 Hz, we observe a pattern of “amplification-deamplification-amplification” from the east to the west end of the San Gabriel Mountains, which is predicted in numerical experiments by \citet{liuScatteringSeismicWaves2020} that strongly varying amplification appear along the short axis of a hill as frequency increases.

It is particularly noticeable that DUR within 10 km to the source is strongly amplified in both low and high frequencies, mostly to the north coincided with the northwest end of the Santa Ana Mountains. Because almost no PGV reduction is present in this region, topography seems to act as a significant scatter that broaden the wave duration on the side facing coming wavefields, as the back side show contrary effects that DUR is reduced. Beyond this distance, our results show a clear negative correlation between the effects on PGV amplification and DUR lengthening, suggesting that topography redistributes seismic energy from the large-amplitude first arrivals to the adjacent coda waves, particularly at the higher frequencies. \citet{imperatoriRoleTopographyLateral2015} also noticed that topographic effects can be approximated by backscattering models in that topography scattering is mainly composed of backscattering waves, which yield decrease in peak amplitudes and increase in duration.

Nonetheless, \citet{leeEffectsRealisticSurface2009} noticed that the effects from topography interfere with those from path and directivity, and thus the observed patterns are likely relevant to the geomorphy in this region for this event location specifically.


\subsection{Frequency-Dependent Attenuation}\label{highf:qf}
\Cref{fig:highf-9} shows the horizontal- and vertical-component FAS generated from three different attenuation models, namely $Q_S=0.1V_S$ (constant $Q$), $Q_S=0.75V_Sf^{0.4}$, $Q_S=0.1V_Sf^{0.3}$, $Q_S=0.1V_Sf^{0.6}$. The $Q(f)$ models and the constant $Q$ model diverges above 1 Hz as expected, with more high-frequency energy sustained in the former, resulting in a better match to data until $Q_S=0.1V_Sf^{0.6}$, which tends to overpredict towards the high end of the bandwidth and yields equally poor match compared to the constant $Q$ model. Among the four attenuation models, $Q_S=0.075V_Sf^{0.4}$ and $Q_S=0.1V_Sf^{0.3}$ best predict the FAS of the data, though the former slightly underpredicts the horizontal components above 1 Hz and the latter slightly overpredicts the vertical component between 1.3 to 3.2 Hz. The finding that the power-law exponent of about 0.4 being optimal in our models is consistent with the inversion results in Southern California by \citet{linFrequencyDependentAttenuationWaves2018}.


Despite the significant amplification of FAS in high frequencies above about 2.5 Hz for the frequency-dependent $Q$ models, PGV at distance farther than 40 km from the source is still underpredicted (\cref{fig:highf-10}). Considering the overall good fit within 40 km, the $Q$ models explored are fair good approximation of the real attenuation. However, we note that the good fit is a balanced product of overprediction in the LAB to the west and underpredition to the north and east, which indicates potential inaccuracy in the background velocity model. \Cref{fig:highf-8} has shown that topography itself is not responsible for producing this bipartitional discrepancy, which may suggests artificial effects from the shear impedance near the basin edges in the CVM (see \cref{fig:highf-2}) that needs further calibration, or indicates different $Q$ models to be considered for basins and rock/shallow sediments, or both.

\subsection{Small-scale heterogeneities}
\Cref{fig:highf-11} shows the effects of adding a von Karman distribution of small-scale heterogeneities (SSHs) with $\sigma = 5\%$ and horizontal correlation length of 5000 m compared to the reference model on PGV and DUR in the frequency bands 0.15-1 Hz and 2.5-5 Hz. \citet{savranGroundMotionSimulation2019} studied a smaller region up to 2.5 Hz, roughly in the center of our simulated domain, found that SSH presents itself as a second-order source of misfit that yields relatively small influence on ground motions. Our results generally agree with their findings, and further show that SSHs have stronger effects at farther distance and in higher frequencies.

\citet{przybillaEstimationCrustalScattering2009} performed analysis using elastic radiative transfer theory and showed that the direction dependence of scattering can be identified by $ak$, where $a$ is the correlation length and $k$ is the wave number. For $ak \approx 1$, waves interact with heterogeneous medium most intensively because the wavelength and correlation length are in the same order. When $ak\gg 1$ waves are predominantly scattered in the forward direction, which generates geometric focusing in the early arrivals and leads to larger peak amplitudes, and vice versa for $ak \ll 1$. In the case with $a=5000$ m, our model generally confines to the forward scattering regime and PGV is amplified, which is shown quantitatively in \Cref{fig:highf-12}. As the frequency increases, $k$ and thus $ak$ tends to increase as well, causing generally weaker scattering effects as deviating from the most intensive scattering regime, thus the median difference closer to 0 for both PGV and DUR. However, higher frequencies wavefields are capable of resolving finer structure, and may induce larger spatial variability in scattering effects, represented by larger standard deviations.

\section{Discussions}
With the effects of various model features on ground shaking discussed above, we have reached a point to further explore whether it is possible and how we are able to combine theses known effects into a sophisticated model to better represent the realistic crust structure, and therefore the characteristics of ground motions extending to a significantly higher frequency range than previous physics-based simulations. \Cref{tab:highf-2} lists part of models explored in our simulations and thse composite models will be refered to by their model ID in the following discussions to avoid tedious model descriptions. Note that model ID does not represent any ranking of goodness of fit.

\subsection{Topography and Shallow Velocity Taper}\label{highf:topoandtaper}
\citet{huCalibrationNearsurfaceSeismic2021} showed the improvements from reducing shallow velocities in CVM-S, especially in regions poorly constrained by limited geological information, by applying a generic taper function based on $V_{S30}$.
Their validation process is, however, restricted to frequency below 1 Hz with flat surface. Here we extend the examination of this method to higher frequency, particularly with the topography considered, as previous studies have suggested the combined effects by topography with local geology including stratigraphy and low-velocity near-surface layers.

We followed \citet{huCalibrationNearsurfaceSeismic2021} and divided the 259 stations into two groups: type A representing sites with good geological constraints and type B representing sites with poor geological constraints. Type B is characterized by unrealistically large surface $V_S$ and lack of change with depth in the top 500-1000 m in CVMs. \Cref{fig:highf-13} shows the median FAS over both types of sites from various models (see \cref{tab:highf-2} for model features). Similar with \citet{huCalibrationNearsurfaceSeismic2021}, type A sites are insensitive to the shallow velocity tapering, while the model with shallow velocities from the original, untapered CVM-S (Model 8) is found to significantly underpredict the FAS at type B sites in the full bands. The underprediction becomes smaller as frequency increases, suggesting that even higher-frequency response is not captured by either the CVM-S or the tapered shallow velocity structure. Topography appears to yield only small effects in terms of FAS (Model 1 versus Model 10) by reducing the FAS in vertical component between 1-3 Hz for both types of sites and horizontal components between 0.4-1.1 Hz for type B site. It is interesting that we observed equally strong effects in vertical components compared to horizontal components, which is somewhat different from previous experiments \citep[][and the references therein]{massaOverviewTopographicEffects2014}. Moreover, the models with $\gamma=0.6$ (Model 1, 8, 10) show a trend of growing overprediction above 2-3 Hz, which can be improved by reducing $\gamma$ to 0.3 (Model 2).


\subsection{Anelastic Attenuation and $\kappa$}
The shape and amplitude of the FAS for strong ground motions reveal fundamental information about the physical processes of source rupture and wave propagation through the earth crust. At high frequencies above the corner frequency up to the noise level of Nyquist frequency, the FAS is observed to decay exponentially \citep{anderson1984model}, which can be described by the spectral decay parameter $\kappa$. Anderson and Hough found consistent $\kappa$ values in the range of 0.04-0.07 for Southern California, and only weak distance dependency that $\kappa$ increases with distance. The authors endorsed the hypothesis by \citet{hanksFmax1982} that the behavior of $\kappa$ is primarily caused by the subsurface geological structure close to the stations.

With the processed synthetics and records, we calculated $\kappa$ from a least-square fit to the spectra, taking the average of the two horizontal components, between 2-5 Hz in frequency-log (FAS) space. The spectra is then stacked over either the whole set of stations or the stations grouped into bins separated by the hypocentral distance to reduce the high-frequency oscillations in FAS at a single station. The frequency bandwidth was selected so that spectral decay starts to show up yet below the highest frequency our simulations can resolve.

\Cref{fig:highf-14} shows the stacked FAS for a series of models. We have examined that topography and $V_S$ taper depth has minor effects on the stacked FAS, thus are not shown in the figure. The model with frequency-independent attenuation (i.e., $Q_S=0.1V_S$) appears to decay too rapidly and yields larger $\kappa$ than data; while frequency-dependent attenuation models produce a slower decay as frequency increases. As a result, the model with frequency-independent attenuation tends to underpredict the FAS at higher frequencies (above 1-1.5 Hz), which is improved for $Q_S=0.05V_Sf^{0.6}$, and overprediction is even observed when the coefficient $Q_S/V_S$ further increases from 0.05 to 0.1, with the power-law exponent of 0.6.

Our calculated $\kappa$ from data at the entire set of stations is 0.061, which is consistent with that measured by \citet{anderson1984model}. The single $\kappa$, though representing an across-domain attenuation characteristics, is oversimplified and neglects site-specific information when our domain contains two distinctive geological structures, i.e. mountains and valleys, and thus rock types. It is natural to calculate $\kappa$ for each subset of stations grouped by their distance to the source to ensure the similarity among each group of stations. Panel (b) in \Cref{fig:highf-14} shows the stacked FAS for the same models as in panel (a) and the corresponding $\kappa$ values as a function of $R_{hypo}$. The models with power-law attenuation are generally in good agreement with data, especially in the distance range with dense site distribution, e.g., 20-45 km. We observed that $\kappa$ first increases slowly with distance, as reported by \citet{anderson1984model}, but then decreases to a low level rapidly at some distance bins beyond 45 km. This is likely due to the relatively fewer site numbers, or the fact that $\kappa$ is a strong localized parameter with spatial variability determined by site effects, which is evidence in \citet{anderson1984model} as well. Nonetheless, The smaller $\kappa$ at distance greater than 45 km may indicate stronger attenuation in these regions compared to near-source regions which are mostly sedimentary basins.

The small difference between $Q_S=0.05V_Sf^{0.6}$ and $Q_S=0.1V_Sf^{0.6}$ suggests that the central parameter governing $\kappa$ is the power-law exponent, instead of $Q_S/V_S$. While it is straightforward to rule out the poor-fitting frequency-independent attenuation model, determination of the best frequency-determined attenuation model is more difficult, considering the spatial variability. The three models $Q_S=0.05V_Sf^{0.6}$, $Q_S=0.075V_Sf^{0.4}$, $Q_S=0.1V_Sf^{0.3}$ produce similar $\kappa$ values. Based on the results in \Cref{highf:qf} and \Cref{highf:topoandtaper}, we prefer the models with $\gamma=0.3-0.4$. The overall good match obtained by frequency-dependent attenuation models indicates that frequency dependency is critical in fitting the high-frequency spectral decay.

\section{Conclusions}

% The fractal structure of topography, causing interaction of seismic waves at different wavelengths, greatly complicates interpretation of its effects on the ground motion at frequencies, as noted by \citet{booreNoteEffectSimple1972} and \citet{panzeraEvidenceTopographicEffects2011}. We thus expect stronger ground motion variability caused by complex topography, which will generate stronger regional concentration of amplification and deamplification, especially at higher frequencies. 

% We notice that most features we explored tend to prolong the signal duration except reducint the minimum $V_S$. \citet{o2009volcano} reported that intrinsic attenuation reduces coda wave duration without introducing waveform complexity. Thus, including a lower-velocity layer and stronger intrisic attenuation is likely to improve the fitting.

% Within 10-20 km away from the source, which is generally deemed to be dominated by source effects, velocity heterogeneities and topography can induce ground motion variability. SSHs are found to result more PGV amplification than topography, which almost has no influence; while topography increases the duration remarkably over the full bandwidth we studied. Considering the relatively moderate relief near the source, topographic effects should be underlined in ground motion prediction even in less mountainous reginos.

% Based on accessibility of more accurate surface elevation information, mathematical descriptions of small-scale heterogeneities and frequency-dependent attenuation and community efforts in assessing shallow material structure, we explored various features and the complicated trade-offs between them. We have shown that physics-based deterministic numerical simulations are capable of capturing the most important characteristics of the ground motions incited by the $M_w$ 5.1 2014 La habra earthquake. Our results show that such high-frequency simulations can be a valuable complement to the stochastic models that evaluate seismic hazard up to 25 Hz. Because of our great advance in pushing up the frequency range of deterministic simulations (from 1-2 Hz in most previous simulations to 5 Hz), the uncertainties in stochastic methods generating higher-frequency synthetics can be reduced significantly.
% The fact that the GOFs at lower frequencies tend to be higher than at high frequencies is attributed to lack of enough high-resolution geological structure. The best geologically-constrained fine structure is surface topography, which increases peak ground motions at mountain tops and yields stronger effects at higher frequency, especially decreasing the ground shaking amplitude and prolonging the duration at low reliefs. The inclusion of more realistic low velocities is of relative minor importance, due to its sparsity in the model. However, stations underlain by very soft soils, with $V_S$ as low as 200 m/s, can still experience at most 80\% overprediction in PGV that is not captured when velocities are clamped at a higher value, e.g. 500 m/s. Small-scale heterogeneities (SSHs), generally reduce the peak ground motions and increase the durations, in a way similar to that of topography. More importantly, the models with SSHs always generate a better fit in duration compared to the model without SSHs. The frequency-dependent attenuation mainly amplifies the ground motions, and is critical in fitting the spectra decay according to our examination of the high-frequency decay ($\kappa$) as a function of distance.

% Generally speaking, the measurements related to peak values, response spectra and duration are almost always best predicted; while the fits of the Arias intensity, energy and Fourier amplitude spectra are more difficult to improve. Furthermore, among the poor measures, the large standard deviations of Arias and energy across various models indicate the even greater difficulty in fitting, in contrary to Anderson’s (\citeyear{andersonQuantitativeMeasureGoodnessOfFit2004}) speculation; while the Fourier spectra shows a very low standard deviation, which implies some systematic misfit. By examining the velocity profiles and FAS at rock sites, we found the unrealistic near-surface velocities in the CVM-S likely explains this misfit. Furthermore, introducing near-surface low velocities, e.g. via a $V_{S30}$-based method, can greatly improve the underprediction. [[Brief description of the refinement model up to 5 Hz]]
% With the effects and importance of the feature summarized, a subset of our well-performed models with these features included, achieve a fair improvement in terms of the proposed GOF criterion. In contrast, the simplest models without incorporating any additional features yield consistently lower GOF scores with the increase of frequency. Our results suggest that the major source of misfits is the poor constraints in the underlying velocity model at the high resolution required for our high-frequency simulations.  The composite models that generated the best fit suggests that incorporating topography, frequency-dependent attenuations (e.g. $Q_S=0.05V_Sf^{0.6}$ or $Q_S=0.1V_Sf^{0.6}$) and SSHs is a valid supplement to the velocity model in numerical simulations.
In the future, we expect advancements in community velocity models, with further calibrated features that are explored in this study, can help improve the fit to data. In addition, the computational cost is still a barrier for us to perform more detailed investigations, which will be partly solved once the AWP code with discontinuous mesh and topography is available. It will be possible to extend such studies to larger earthquakes, possibly with nonlinear effects, which remains a major concern for residents in Southern California.
