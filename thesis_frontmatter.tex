    %% DEDICATION
    %
    %  You have three choices here:
    %    1. Use the ``dedication'' environment.
    %       Put in the text you want, and everything will be formated for
    %       you. You'll get a perfectly respectable dedication page.
    %
    %
    %    2. Use the ``mydedication'' environment.  If you don't like the
    %       formatting of option 1, use this environment and format things
    %       however you wish.
    %
    %    3. If you don't want a dedication, it's not required.

        % I have always been recalling the time I walked along the La Jolla beach years ago, when the afterglow of sunset lingered forever, and the path ahead extended beyond the sight of my eyes. It came to me that the time paused, and I could repeat those days once and once again, which, I do not know when, fades out and now the end of this journey arrives. Fortunately, I have been accompanied by the greatest people, to whom I owe my sincere appreciation.

        First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest sense of gratitude my supervisor, Professor Kim Olsen, for his invaluable supervision, support, and tutelage during the course of my PhD degree. Kim always gives me the freedom to explore problems, allows me to try different approaches, and correct me every time before I dive deep into a wrong direction. He is always responsive to asking and patient to answering, even if my questions are naive. His suggestions and comments are so detailed and constructive that they easily refresh my thoughts and guide me towards real research. I am always impressed by his skills in applying physical sense in solving problems and extracting relevant knowledge from his "brain" hard drive accurately in no time. He emphasized big picture in seismology, while in the same time teached me how to present scientific findings, polish academic reports and communicate with the community. What I learned from Kim is a great wealth to me in my whole life.

        It is my privilege to thank my committee members for their great mentorship and guidance. I thank Professor Steve Day, who is always supportive and warm. Even during the hardest days, I feel encouraged thinking of his optimistic altitudes and enthusiasm in life. He is rigorous to scientific problems but open to every exploration, to which he always provides precious comments and insights. It was an honor to attend his retirement ceremony in person and see how a life of contribution to science is remembered and respected. Professor Peter Shear is the person leading me to this field by his popular "Introduction to Seismology", which is still the source of answers in my study. He showed me that science can be elegant yet fun. I thank Professor Samuel Shen for his valuable help in mathematics in our discussions. I also thank Professor Joel Conte for his kind suggestions and comments. Dr. Daniel Roten is extraordinarily supportive in Kim's group, who taught me about the details in research practice from the beginning. I cannot overestimate how much I learned from him, and it is my privilege to work with someone as versatile, brilliant, and productive as Daniel. I am also grateful to Professor Shuo ma at SDSU, who is warm and caring, for sharing his experiences and life advice.

        I am grateful to all the professors at Scripps and SDSU, who taught a wide series of courses that prepared me in my following research, including Professor Duncan Agnew, Professor Adrian Borsa, Professor Catherine Constable, Professor Steven Constable, Professor Yuri Fialko, Professor Guy Masters, Professor David Sandwell, Professor Peter Shearer, and Professor Dave Stegman at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UCSD; Professor Michael Holst in Department of Mathematics at UCSD; Professor Shou Ma and Professor Kim Olsen at SDSU.

        My research fulfillment would not be possible without the help and communications from my coauthors and collaborators from the Southern California Earthquake Center. I thank Kim Olsen, Steven Day, Daniel Roten, Christine Goulet, Robert Graves, Fabio Silva, Scott Callaghan, Kevin Milner for their incredible collaborations and discussions.

        I appreciate the support and friendship from my incredible fellows and friends: Nan Wang, Teyang Yeh, Yongfei Wang, Shiying Nie, Qian Yao, Wei Wang, Zefeng Li, Yuxiang Zhang, Bill Savran, Kyle Withers, Drake Singleton, Rumi Takedatsu, Xiaohua Xu, Kang Wang, Wenyuan Fan, Zhao Chen, Yuval Levy, Zeyu Jin, Yue Du, Zheng Fang, Junlong Hou, Mingda Li, Yuan Huang. Thank you for making my time at San Diego a wonderful memory. I also appreciate the administrative advisors and staffs, including Gilbert Bretado, Wayne Farquharson, Paul Dean, and Sara Miceli at UCSD; Irene Occhiello, Pia Parrish, Heather Webb, Susan Langsford, and Pat Walls at SDSU, for their consistent and timely assistance.

        Finally, I would also like to extend my deepest gratitude to my parents, Xiaoyang and Xiuhong, for always listening to me, supporting me, and encouraging me. Lastly but most importantly, I thank Fei for being there for me through thick and think, for always believing in me, and for enriching my life in numerous amounts of ways.

    \begin{abstract}
        High-frequency ($f_{max}$ > 1 Hz) ground motions are closely relevant to building response associated with small structures of the engineering interests. Gaining an deeper understanding of the propagation of seismic waves and characterisitc of ground motions, is therefore a principal goal for seismologists and earthquake engineers. Earthquake simulations, physcis-based deterministic simulations in particular, as a valuable complement to (often inadequate) recorded data, have drawn significant attention from the seismic community in the last decades. With the potential ability to accurately characterize broadband wavefield, numerical simulations have their own limitations, namely the difficulty in charaterizing the underlying physical parameters in fine scale and accommodating regional-scale domains for risking earthquake study. The primary objective of this dissertations is to explore various model properties that impose high-frequency effects. Chapter \hyperref[chap:intro]{1} is an introduction, providing background and motivation for each of the following chapters. Chapter \hyperref[chap:eks]{2} studies nonlinear effects using dynamic simulations and propose an equivalent kinematic source generator to emulate near-source plasticity in terms of the resulting peak ground velocities. Chapter \hyperref[chap:vs30]{3} and \hyperref[chap:highf]{4} focus on model characteristics that govern the high-frequency ground shaking. Chapter \hyperref[chap:vs30]{3} proposes a calibration approach that enhances the near-surface velocity structure insufficiently resolved in community velocity models. In Chapter \hyperref[chap:highf]{4}, we intensively simulate a series of models with topography, small-scale heterogeneities, frequency-dependent attenuation, low near-surface velocities to investigate their contributions in modulating wavefields and ground motions as the frequency extends up to 5 Hz. In Chapter \hyperref[chap:etf]{5}, we incoporates surface topography in constraining the 3D subsurface structure to predicte site response.
